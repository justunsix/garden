## Why Use Rust

- Performance metrics
- Memory safety
- Different production usage
  - Cloud and desktop applications
  - Large technology company usage and support
  - Linux kernel
- Programmer preference and productivity

### Use Cases

- Performance critical applications due to speed and memory efficiency
  and no garbage collection
- Reduced security vulnerabilities due to memory safety
  - Example: operating systems, user facing systems
- Other examples:
  - Command line applications
  - Application Programming Interfaces (API)
  - Distributed systems
  - Front end
    - WebAssembly
  - Systems:
    - Databases
    - Security
    - Data
    - Devices
  - Other
    - Virtual reality
    - Blockchain

## Learning Rust Tips

- Beginner learning
  - Read Rust book (twice)
  - Rustlings exercises, redo ones important to you
  - Rust by Example
- Use `cargo clippy`

### Try

cargo packages (can use cargo binstall):

- sccache for caching compiled packages
- irust - repl
- bacon - clippy and build, test - compilments LSP editor for help
- cargo-info - check crates
