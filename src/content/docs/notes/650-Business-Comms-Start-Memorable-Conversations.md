## Framework

Read –\> Comment –\> Engage

Example:

- Observe, listen to environment
  - Does person look open to engage with?
  - What comment can I make?
  - How can I engage them?
- Wait for a queue to comment with a person (eye contact, smile),
  comment on environment
- Engage with an open ended question related to the environment or
  situation

## Challenges and Solutions

- Freezing - Practice in a familiar situation (like work, check how
  people are doing or plans for a weekend)
- Oversharing about yourself - Focus on the other person (I appreciate
  you …)
- Share meaningless content - Focus on immediate environment (what
  brought you here, I love the food here)

## Cultural and personality considerations

- Use your natural strengths and practice:
  - Introverts tend to make more insightful comments
  - Power distance: example: East Asian (formal, hierarchy in corporate
    environment) vs Western (more casual)
    - Add appropriate questions

## Drills for conversation starters

Imagine a situation

- Make eye contact
- Comment on situation or person relevant to context, ask open ended
  question.
- Example situations
  - e.g. in an airport, that suitcase will be easy to spot! are you
    travelling far?
  - e.g. its raining and in elevator, wow it is raining hard, did you
    have to walk far?
  - e.g. shopping, I'm the glad lines are moving well today, do you find
    it easy to find things here?, do you shop how often?
  - e.g. cafeteria, I love how the entrées here always change, do you
    eat lunch often here?
- Tips:
  - Connect on the human level (weather, environmental architecture,
    event)
  - Look for commonalities (e.g. clothing, interests, likes)
  - It is ok to have a quick conversation and not overstay your welcome

## Existing a conversation

- "Enjoy your day", "It was nice meeting your", "Have a safe trip"
- Imply a future connection for work colleagues
