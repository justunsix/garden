## 5 Things in Learning Process - Information Sources, Boredom, Attention, Working Memory, Intellectual

Source: [How To Escape Mediocrity & Get Ahead Of 99% Of People \| Cal
Newport](https://youtu.be/Wy7lsdvmWpk) and my personal notes on examples
implementations

My personal summary: Learn like you would before the internet -
scheduled learning, books

1.  Limit Sources of Information by Time and High Quality Sources
    - Daily: curated daily news source (1 or few) like New York Times,
      [CBC News Lite Editor's
      pick](https://www.cbc.ca/lite/news?sort=editors-picks)
    - Monthly
      - 2-6 in depth articles from professional journals/magazines like
        New Yorker, The Atlantic, Wall Street Journal
    - Seasons:
      - Books written by expert researchers
      - Consume media with goal of 1:1 fun/smart ratio of fun media to
        learning / high quality media
    - Example on reading about artificial intelligence: You will learn
      about major changes in daily news. Read a magazine article on AI,
      then a book on an AI topic.
    - See book "Digital minimalism : on living better with less
      technology"
2.  Be ok with boredom
    - For example reduce phone uses to physical locations and times
3.  Attention
    - Do difficult work or high quality activity, for example use
      pomodoro technique with longer sessions over time
    - Setup environment for different activities
4.  Strengthen working memory
    - Solve problems with a light activity like walking, ok for mind to
      wander than return to problem
5.  Practice being intellectual
    - For example, do learning and research processes of higher
      education
    - Look at secondary sources (context), before studing a primary
      source to appreciate it
    - Record your learning and knowledge like a taking notes on subjects
      and add to notes / essays over time

## 1 Page Productivity System

Newport](https://youtu.be/LzWuRTzPebo)

The system uses 2 basics things in most work environments: 1. Calendar,
2. 1 sheet of paper, for example notebook.

Use the calendar as the main tool to track meetings, work.

### Paper

Write ideas, tasks on paper. If possible, move item to the calendar like
time for task in calendar and cross item off.

### Calendar

Use calendar for time blocks.

### Maintenance Mode

If items come like emails/requests, schedule them in calendar for later
or say no during maintenance mode. The mode is temporary to allow you to
recharge. Maintenance keeps items and calendar current.

Maintaining the paper: when the sheet is full, for each item in the
paper:

- Copy to new paper / sheet or remove it if not needed anymore
- Move to the calendar or put note in future date
