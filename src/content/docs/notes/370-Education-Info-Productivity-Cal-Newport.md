## 5 Things in Learning Process - Information Sources, Boredom, Attention, Working Memory, Intellectual

Source: [How To Escape Mediocrity & Get Ahead Of 99% Of People \| Cal
Newport](https://youtu.be/Wy7lsdvmWpk) and my personal notes on examples
implementations

My personal summary: Learn like you would before the internet -
scheduled learning, books

1.  Limit Sources of Information by Time and High Quality Sources
    - Daily: curated daily news like New York Times
    - Monthly
      - 2-6 in depth articles from journals
    - Seasons:
      - Books
      - Media with goal of 1:1 ratio of learning to fun media
2.  Be ok with boredom
    - For example reduce phone uses to physical locations and times
3.  Attention
    - Do difficult work or high quality activity, for example use
      pomodoro technique with longer sessions over time
    - Setup environment for different activities
4.  Strengthen working memory
    - Solve problems with a light activity like walking, ok for mind to
      wander than return to problem
5.  Practice being intellectual
    - For example, do learning and research processes of higher
      education
    - Look at secondary sources (context), before studing a primary
      source to appreciate it
    - Record your learning and knowledge like a taking notes on subjects
      and add to notes / essays over time
