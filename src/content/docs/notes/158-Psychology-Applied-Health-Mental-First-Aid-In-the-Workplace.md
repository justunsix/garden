## Mental Health in the Workplace for Employees

**Mental Health in the Workplace for Employees**

**Introduction Module**

**A word of caution**

The information in this e-Learning is intended to provide an
introduction to mental health in the workplace.

Please do not attempt to diagnose yourself or others. If you suspect a
problem, please consult with a qualified doctor.

**Module 1 – Stigma**

**Learning Objectives**

At the end of this module, you will be able to:

- understand the impact of mental health issues in the workplace,
- discover how many Canadians experience mental health issues,
- recognize mental health issues as one of the leading causes of
  disability worldwide, and
- evaluate the stigma surrounding mental health.

**Why should I be concerned?**

Ask yourself, "Why should I be concerned about mental health in my
workplace?"

Mental health issues are growing in importance. Regardless of sex, age,
race, and ethnicity, mental health is a problem that touches everyone.
It impacts:

- you,
- your co-workers,
- your organization,
- your country, and
- the world

**Canadian Perspective**

Can you guess what percentage of Canadians experience mental health
issues each year? Is it:

- 10%
- 20%
- 25%
- 50%

If you guessed 20% you are correct!

The answers may startle you. But 1 in 5 Canadians will experience some
type of mental health issue each year.  An equally startling statistic,
of that 20% of Canadians, only 6% seek or receive treatment. (source –
CMHA (Ont.) 2012)

**The global perspective**

The World Health Organization predicts that by 2020, depression alone
will be the second-leading cause of disability worldwide, second only to
heart disease.

You might also be surprised to know that:

- 7.5 million Canadians suffer from depression, anxiety, substance
  abuse, or other disorders each year.
- Mental disorders cost the Canadian economy \$51 billion dollars
  annually.
- 78% of those diagnosed with depression keep it to themselves for fear
  of losing their jobs.
- Physical illness absences increase 2-3 times when accompanied by
  depression.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Impacts to organizations**

Every day, 500,000 Canadians are absent from work because of a mental
health issue.

In many cases, psychological claims are the number one cause of salaried
short-term and long-term disability claims.

Antidepressants are the number two most claimed drug category by
employees and their families, with the top 5 stress-related conditions.
Stress is the number one reason for Employee Assistance Program (EAP)
counseling.

**Why not seek treatment?**

You may be asking yourself, "why don't people seek or receive
treatment?" In many cases, the problem is related to stigma.

Let's look at the different types of stigma. Roll your mouse over each
type below or press the corresponding letter (A, B, and C) on your
keyboard to learn more.

Societal Stigma is the type of stigma that speaks to how people view a
person with a mental disorder. Society feels uncomfortable about mental
disorders as it is not often seen like other illnesses such as heart
disease or cancer.

Through stereotypes, people believe that an individual with a mental
disorder has a weak character or is inevitably dangerous.

Self Stigma is a type of stigma that a person with a mental disorder
experiences internally.

People with mental disorders report that there is a real barrier in
their progress to getting mentally healthy since they worry how people
perceive them or how others will judge them.

Associative stigma is a type of stigma that is discriminatory or
harassing behaviour resulting in inequitable and unfair treatment of
people with a mental disorder and their family members.

This often manifests in forms of rejection encountered by someone with a
mental disorder and their family.

**Stigma in the workplace**

Let's look at some examples of how stigma manifests itself in the
workplace. Examples can include:

- failing to grant an interview to a qualified job applicant who has
  disclosed a mental disorder because it may be assumed that they may be
  unpredictable and emotionally volatile,
- making assumptions that a colleague recovering from depression is
  incapable of doing their job or is unreliable,
- spreading rumours that a colleague's mental disorder is "all in their
  head,"
- assuming they are lazy and using mental disorder as an excuse to get
  out of doing their job, and
- telling inappropriate jokes about someone's mental disorder.

**Gustav's case study – part 1**

Gustav has been a highly respected member of your work team for many
years. You work on many projects with him and often eat lunch with him
in the cafeteria. You like Gustav and think of him as a friend.

Lately, you have noticed that Gustav has changed. At work, he has begun
to come in late and looking disheveled. Instead of speaking up in team
meetings as he used to, Gustav just sits there, staring at the wall
until the meeting is dismissed. You know that he has missed key
deadlines on important projects, because all of the rest of your team
have had to scramble to get the work out on time. When a team member
made a half-humorous remark about this, Gustav seemed to over-react by
responding in a loud and rude way.

**Continued**

You haven't seen much of Gustav in the cafeteria lately. From what you
have heard, he just stays at his desk through the lunch hour, however,
he is the topic of much discussion. Today at lunch time one person said,
"I heard that old Gustav is seeing a psychiatrist. I'm not surprised
because nowadays his behaviour scares me. They should get him out of
here before he hurts someone. It's not like he's of any use to the team
anymore." You noticed that nobody protested or stood up for Gustav. In
fact, they all seemed to agree that the best thing to do was to keep
their distance.

Members of the team began to stigmatize Gustav as soon as word got out
that he was seeing a psychiatrist. Why?

Pause for a few minutes here and reflect on why the team reacted this
way.

Answers may vary, but your answer could include any or all of these
points:

- People do not know what to say or how to act towards someone with a
  mental health issue.

- It is hard to understand mental health issues and often we are afraid
  of what we do not know.

- They may be worried that Gustav might behave in an unpredictable
  manner.

- The team does not realize that mental health issues can be temporary,
  managed, and sometimes treated, or

- They have heard stories about people with mental health issues
  becoming violent in the workplace.

**Continued**

Now imagine that everything else in the case study was the same, except
that Gustav was suffering from cancer rather than a mental health issue.
Would the team react by stigmatizing Gustav?

Pause for a few minutes here and reflect on how you may respond in this
situation.

Answers may vary, but your answer should include these points:

- In general, people understand physical illness better than mental
  health issues.
- As long as the physical illness is not contagious, people do not fear
  those who are ill and therefore have less need to stigmatize them.
- People know that physical illnesses are treatable and that many people
  can recover from them. While this is true for mental health issues as
  well, many people do not realize this, and
- People are more comfortable with physical illnesses primarily because
  they are often not stigmatized the same way.

**Continued**

You are Gustav's friend. You seek him out at lunchtime and in a private
place you tell him that you are happy to hear that he is now getting
help.

Gustav becomes upset and shouts, "You are just like the rest of them.
You think I'm crazy. You probably think I can't do my job anymore, too!"
And storms off.

Why do you think Gustav reacted this way? Reflect on the situation to
determine what may have caused Gustav to react the way that he did.

Answers may vary, but your answer should include these points:

- Likely, Gustav believes that his friend is judging him - he feels hurt
  and isolated.
- Gustav may not have shared his health concerns with others on his
  team. People with a mental health issue are sometimes afraid to tell
  others or to seek out treatment for fear of being judged or labelled.

**Gustav's case study, conclusion**

In this case study, we learned that each member of the team has a
different view or understanding of mental health issues. To be
supportive team members, we have to take part in removing the stigma
surrounding mental health. Each of us is responsible for taking part in
the safety and well-being of our team.

In addition, we must also maintain privacy and confidentiality at the
highest level to avoid awkward situations between team members.

**Summary**

Well done. As you can see, mental health is a large and growing problem
not only in Canada but around the world.

It can impact everyone in our society in some way including those we
work with so we have to be sensitive and respond in a caring way when
dealing with mental disorders.

We also learned that stigma associated with a mental disorder is a great
barrier to the recovery of those with mental disorders.

**Module 2 – Mental Health Facts**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Objectives**

By the end of this module, you will learn how to:

- Describe what mental health is and how it can affect an individual's
  quality of life.
- Understand the Mental Health Continuum. We'll learn that our mental
  health is fluid and can change over time.
- Appreciate medical science's view of mental health disorders, and
  understand how these are diseases of the brain.
- Understand the most common mental health issues that a significant
  number of people face.
- Better manage your stress.

**Mental health continuum**

Let's look at the full continuum of mental health. It starts with good
mental health, being balanced, and handling the ups and downs of
everyday life.

The Mental Health Commission of Canada maintains that good mental health
acts as a "buffer from the stresses and hardships that are part of
everyday life for most of us." Unfortunately, many of us take our mental
health for granted and it is not until our mental health is negatively
impacted that we are able to fully appreciate how important it is.

In the middle of the continuum is a Temporary Mental Health Problem most
often triggered by a significant upset in life or a major stressor, that
throws us upside down for a period of time. Any one of us might
experience such a stressor during our lives.

On the far right is the category of Mental Disorders, seen by medical
science as diseases of the brain.  This is when a person usually
requires some professional help to get back on track. It is extremely
difficult to will oneself back to good mental health. It is helpful to
think of mental health as a continuum. In summary, a person's mental
health status is not static, but can fluctuate across the continuum,
moving in either direction.

**Mental health defined**

Good mental health is comprised of many factors that can affect an
individual's quality of life including the ability to:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- think independently and make decisions,
- experience enjoyment and socialize,
- feel in charge and able to make choices, and
- Communicate our wants and needs straightforwardly.

*According to Health Canada, mental health is defined by **"the capacity
to feel, think and act in ways that enhance one's ability to enjoy life
and deal with challenges."***

- This definition is useful – it is simple, down-to-earth and easy to
  understand. But let's dive down a little bit to better understand what
  it means for us practically.
- It begins with the capacity to 'feel'. Why is the word 'feel' so
  prominent? We can understand why the word 'think' is a part of the
  definition, but why is being in touch with our own feelings so
  important?

Good mental health means…

- We feel well
- We can cope with difficulty, and
- We can achieve our personal goals

**Mental health defined - Feelings**

Good mental health is having …

*"the capacity to **feel,** think and act in ways that enhance one's
ability to enjoy life and deal with challenges."*

*This includes being:*

- in touch with your feelings,
- able to know when to express them when and how you choose,
- sensitive to the emotions of others, and
- able to express empathy

So, why is it useful for us to be aware of our feelings?  First, they
are your guideposts in life, letting you know when you are doing the
right thing and keeping you on track. If you are self-aware, you can
make choices about when and how you express your feelings.

If you are unaware, just operating on auto pilot, your feelings may leak
out in everyday interactions; in ways that you don't really intend. If
the frustration you feel when the traffic is heavier than expected, and
you are late for work, your frustration may become your mood when you
arrive at work and impact the way you deal with colleagues or
customers.  This attitude can be perceived as unprofessional.

If you never express your feelings\*,\* they don't go away. They build
up, like a pressure cooker, and eventually tend to bubble up and affect
your mood, relationships, and even health.

Being sensitive to the feelings of others helps you at home and at work.
Putting yourself in another person's shoes, especially understanding how
they feel, is a key ingredient in expressing empathy, building trust,
and keeping relationships positive.

**Mental health defined – thinking**

Good mental health is having …

*"the capacity to feel, **think** and act in ways that enhance one's
ability to enjoy life and deal with challenges."*

*This includes being:*

- aware of your internal dialogue,
- able to insert a "take two" script,
- aware of the visualizations, and
- able to change the picture to a healthier one.

What do you do when you "think?"

What processes do you engage in that you call thinking?

The most common way you **think** is by talking to yourself.

You compare pros and cons; articulate possible options, and wonder what
is meant by a question. If you are aware of this internal dialogue, you
will become aware of when it is an unhelpful perspective.

For example, if there is a problem on a project you are completing, you
might say to yourself, "Oh my gosh, this is the worst thing that could
have happened! This is going to throw my whole project plan off kilter.
This is terrible!"

Now, this way of representing the situation is bound to make you feel
stressed and upset.

Well, being stressed and upset is not the best attitude to solve the
problem or fix the situation. That is best accomplished by having a
calm, cool, and collected frame of mind. You need to say internally,
“I'm making myself pretty stressed by how I'm framing this problem. It
**IS** a significant problem and I need to solve it, but I'll do a
better job if I'm focused and rational.

Let me reframe this and do a "take two". You can also say, "Yes, this is
a problem, but I'm a good problem solver, I've got a smart team around
me, and we'll get through this. How should I begin?" Then, you can
approach the problem in a constructive way because you are more aware.

Another common way you think is by visualizing, running a movie or
picture in your mind's eye. You remember a past event to assess it, you
imagine a future event to anticipate it.

For good mental health, the key is awareness. If you are aware that you
are producing these images in your mind's eye, you can then have control
and choice. This equals good mental health.

For example, if you are on your way to your in-laws for dinner on Sunday
night, and you catch yourself having an image of the evening ahead, and
it is of yourself "crawling out of your skin" with boredom, you are
heading to a long, unpleasant evening. You can catch yourself and
realize that you are producing this image and it's predicting an
unpleasant time. You are then capable of deciding to change that image
to one that predicts a better time for you, which probably involves
getting engaged in conversations, etc…

**Mental health continuum**

Now that we understand good mental health, let's turn our attention to
the middle of the continuum – temporary mental health problems. In other
words, coping when there has been significant stress or trauma in our
lives:

**Mental health problems are:**

…/temporary problems that can interfere with our ability to function,
and affect our quality of life. You can react to such things as:/

- stressful changes at work,
- illness of a loved one,
- relationship struggles,
- financial uncertainty.

Often resolved through personal coping strategies, taking some down
time, connecting with family & friends, or counselling

Almost everyone will experience mental health problems during their
lifetime. These are temporary problems that might include periods of
worry, trouble sleeping or eating, feeling fatigued, anxious, having
difficulty concentrating, and focusing on work-life responsibilities or
simply being in a bad mood.

Generally, mental health problems will be resolved when we are able to
draw on resources and personal coping strategies, such as taking some
downtime to connect with close friends or family, getting a good night's
sleep, connecting with communities of faith, or speaking with a
counsellor\*.\* We'll look at some resources to help support our mental
health later in this training.

Obviously stress is a significant part of the equation here . . . Let's
now take a closer look at stress – how it works and how we can stay
healthy in the midst of it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Demystifying Stress**

Stress does have value in your life, but left unchecked, stress can lead
to distress and be counterproductive to good mental and physical health.

Biologically, the stress response is designed to be a brief and
temporary reaction to an event that needs your sudden and complete
attention to save you from harm. On the positive side, you need a
certain amount of stress to keep you motivated and safe. In other words,
stress is part of the human condition. A certain mount of stress is
unavoidable. However, when it takes over your life, it can be
problematic. And while stress is unavoidable, the way you perceive or
react to it is not. Let's take a look.

**Stress vs. distress**

- Most personal, social and work related events by themselves are not
  stressful.
- It is how you react to them or how you perceive them that determines
  whether they will cause you distress.

Some personalities are more prone to distress:

- high performers
- perfectionists

Perhaps the most important thing to remember, is that many daily
situations aren't inherently stressful. You have the choice whether
stress will be the keynote speaker in your day.

Given that we can, to a great extent, control our reactions to
situations and not the situations themselves, it makes common sense that
we should take control of our "reaction equipment".  In other words,
when an event happens, whether in our personal, social, or professional
lives, we filter it through our own perceptions or filters to determine
what the event means to us.  The level of stress we feel and how well we
manage that stress, is greatly influenced by our interpretation of the
event.

In truth, being "stressed" gets a bad reputation just for doing what it
was designed to do, it is what we call the "fight of flight" reaction.
This is another name for stress.

And remember stress, in and of itself, is not a mental health disorder.

**The fight or flight stress response**

Without an immediate response to stress, human beings would have likely
failed to thrive and adapt the way we have.  Today, whether in your
personal, social, or professional life, mild stress helps prepare us for
challenges, dealing with difficulty, or avoiding getting hurt.

The diagram depicts that stress itself is unavoidable but our perception
and reaction to it is not.

There are indeed many factors that will contribute to, and result in
stress.  For example, the knowledge that your child has been hurt surely
incites stress!  The key to managing stress is being aware of and
choosing healthy reactions to it.  Essentially, you must work to avoid
reacting habitually to life's uncertainties, and remind yourself not to
'sweat the small stuff.'

**Any perceived threat (real or imagined)**

- Stress reaction is triggered
- Hormones flow into bloodstream (adrenaline, cortisol, noradrenaline)
  - Increases to:
    - Muscle tension
    - Blood pressure
    - Breathing rate
    - Heart rate
    - Mental alertness
    - Emotional anxiety
    - Blood sugars and fats
    - Metabolism
  - Decreases to:
    - Digestion
    - Immune system
    - Mental creativity
    - Emotional stability
    - Sex hormones
- Body prepares itself for the fight or flight

When you do perceive a threat or danger, your body reacts and if you
don’t choose fight or flight, you can end up frozen in your emotional
state. This can have a negative effect on all aspects of your health.

Note: In the lower box, the decreases in functioning that occur with our
digestion, immune system, mental creativity, emotional stability, and
sex hormones.

**Signs of distress**

- PHYSICAL
  - Muscular tension/headaches
  - Upset stomach
  - Shortness of breath
  - Difficulty sleeping/fatigue
  - Grinding/clenching teeth
  - Cold hands & feet
  - Trembling/shaking
  - Frequent colds, flu, infections
- EMOTIONAL
  - Worry/Anxiety
  - Anger
  - Irritability
  - Apathy
  - Hopeless/trapped
  - Out of control
  - Guilty/self-conscious
  - Low self-confidence
- SPIRITUAL
  - Loss of purpose and meaning
  - Questioning values
  - Isolating yourself from friends, family, and your community
  - Loneliness
  - Excessive ‘busyness’
- INTELLECTUAL
  - Impaired judgment
  - Inability to concentrate
  - Easily distracted
  - Memory loss
  - Excessive worry
  - Difficulty in making decisions/procrastination

So, what can you do to stay healthy in the face of inevitable stress of
life? As usual, self-awareness is the key, recognizing the consequences
of distress over time, and choosing healthy responses.

**Coping with stress – staying resilient**

- PHYSICAL
  - Exercise
  - Fitness
  - Diet
  - Yoga
  - Relaxation activities
  - See family doctor regularly
- EMOTIONAL
  - Express emotions
  - Vent with someone who cares
  - Counselling (EFAP)
  - Don’t let it build up
- SPIRITUAL
  - Meditation
  - Inspirational reading, movies
  - Prayer
  - Talk to spiritual advisors and religious leaders
  - Quality family time
- INTELLECTUAL
  - Monitor self-talk and adjust
  - Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
  - One thing at a time approach
  - Don’t sweat the small stuff

It is important to take care of your physical well-being especially
during stressful times.  The most direct way to manage stress is by
simulating the fight or flight that your body and mind has been
preparing for. This literally burns up the adrenalin and cortisol that
you produce and leaves you able to relax and recharge afterward. Many
studies have historically shown the long term benefits of staying fit.
This benefit also accrues to the healthy functioning of your mind.
Excess cortisol in particular can damage brain nerves and compromise our
ability to think properly.

Human beings have feelings and emotions that are born to be expressed.
If you keep your feelings bottled up inside, you risk even more stress
and consequences. It is helpful to vent with someone who cares to deal
with the emotions in order to move on. We'll reinforce the value of the
Employee Family Assistance Program in a moment.

**Spiritually:** It is important to have a sense of purpose in life, a
reason to get up in the morning. If that wanes over time, our life can
turn negative quite quickly.

\*Intellectually:  W\*e've discussed the expression "don't sweat the
small stuff". If you are functioning optimally, you are able to perceive
an event appropriately as "just small stuff" and we manage it. But, if
you are not in a good mindset, you might perceive that same event as a
big deal and become somewhat distressed because you feel unable to
handle the level of stress you feel.

**Rita's story**

Imagine that Rita works near you, although you don't really know her
well. Lately it seems that Rita has changed. She used to be very
participative at team meetings and now she doesn't seem to care.

Also, Rita used to be impeccably dressed, but these days her hair isn't
quite combed and her overall grooming isn't what it used to be. She
seems tired and her eyes often look red.

At lunchtime, instead of joining others in the cafeteria, she sits at
her desk and either stares into space or puts her head into her hands.

**Continued**

So what do you think of Rita's mental health?

You might be tempted to think about her behavior in light of the Mental
Health Continuum, and begin to wonder whether she is dealing with a
serious mental disorder.

But you'd be off course in that interpretation - there are important
facts that you don't know. Rita's mother is extremely ill and has
recently entered hospice care. Rita spends most of her off-work hours at
the hospice centre with her mother, which accounts for the deterioration
in Rita's grooming and for her tired, less engaged demeanor.

**Continued**

The point of this example is that diagnosing from a few observed
symptoms can be very inaccurate.

That is why it is so important to leave diagnosis to the health care
professionals. As a friend, you can potentially help build a bridge to
professional help for them, but let's not try and be diagnosticians
ourselves.

That said, let's explore the last part of the Metal Health Continuum.

**Mental health continuum**

Let's consider the right hand side of our continuum. This is the
category of Mental Disorders, seen by medical science as diseases of the
brain. This is when a person usually requires some professional help to
get back on track.

As we've just discussed, our objective here is not to become
diagnosticians, but rather to better understand these diseases and
thereby reduce our ignorance and prejudices.

**Startling statistics**

Take a minute to read these and reflect. Which statistics stand out for
you? What might be the impact of these statistics in your workplace?

- **7.5 million** Canadians suffer from Depression, Anxiety, Substance
  Abuse or other mental health disorders each year but only
  **one-third** of those who need mental health services in Canada
  actually receive them  (Sources: Canadian Mental Health Association,
  2011; Statistics Canada, 2011)
- **78%** of those diagnosed with depression would keep it to themselves
  for fear over their jobs (Global and Economic Roundtable on Mental
  Health, 2007)

-These statistics mean that we are all likely working with someone with
a mental health issue who won't tell us or anyone else about it. -The
big question is why in today's world, only one-third of those who need
mental health services in Canada are not receiving them.

**The stigma surrounding mental disorders**

**What is stigma?**

Stigma is defined as negative, stereotypical thinking, and prejudicial
attitudes about people who have experienced a mental disorder. Stigma
can result in discriminatory or harassing behaviours that lead to
inequitable and unfair treatment of people who have experienced a mental
disorder, especially in the workplace.

**What is self-stigma?**

Someone with a mental disorder typically feels shame and fears
rejection. Ultimately, self-stigma is the most significant barrier to
getting help. People with a mental disorder, report that how others
judge them is one of their greatest barriers to coming forward and
seeking the help they need. This results in 2/3 of affected people not
getting the help they need. People can't usually get over mental
disorders by relying on inner strength or willpower, but these myths
contribute to self-stigma, preventing affected individuals from getting
help.

**Example of self-stigma**

"I don't know why I'm feeling this sad and hopeless, I wish I could talk
to someone but no one will understand. Everyone will tell me what I
already know; I just need to pick myself up and get it together!"

**What is societal stigma?**

People living with mental disorders face increased rejection and
discrimination from society.

**Example of societal stigma**

"I don't understand what is going on with Pat. We all have to deal with
a lot in our lives and we just manage to do it. The moods and crying
seem over-the-top. I mean, really!"

**What is associative stigma?**

Up to 83% of close friends and family members of someone living with a
mental disorder encounter shame and discrimination.

Example of associative stigma

"It's been an uphill battle since Bob's diagnosis. I understand why each
day seems like a struggle but my family just doesn't get that he tires
easily and is not up to big family gatherings.  They're upset because we
missed the holiday dinner. Now we're not invited to my niece's wedding."

**Diagnosing mental disorders**

Diagnosing mental disorders properly is difficult and complex, and it is
best done by a health care professional.

We will review in some detail, how doctors make diagnoses so that we can
better understand mental disorders and ultimately help reduce stigma.

Mental disorders are defined as a range of disorders affecting the
emotional or mental health of an individual.  It is marked by a
disturbance in thoughts, feelings, and perceptions that is severe enough
to affect day to day functioning.

Thorough descriptions of each mental disorder are contained in a book
called the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM
for short).  Health care professionals use this manual to diagnose
specific mental disorders including, depression, anxiety, alcoholism,
and bi-polar disorder.

Let's explore some of the most common mental health disorders to
understand them better.

**Mental Disorders**

The DSM 5 lists many mental disorders.  Based on recent statistics, the
three most commonly seen in the workplace are:

- Major Depressive Disorder,

- Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and

- Adjustment Disorder

Unlike mental health problems, mental disorders are not temporary
problems that can be resolved through personal coping strategies. They
are far more persistent and severe, and if left untreated, will likely
get worse. Just like physical illnesses, they often require medical
intervention, which includes medication, and psychological counselling.
The good news is that most people affected by these disorders will
recover and get back on their feet.

1 in 5 Canadians will experience a mental health disorder in their
lifetime. Let's learn more about each one.

**Major depressive disorder**

Since it is the most frequently diagnosed and the disorder most likely
to trigger a disability leave, let's provide an overview of the causes
and symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder.

Research suggests that mental disorders are the result of a complex
interaction of genetic, biological, and environmental factors. However,
the brain is the final common pathway for the control of behaviour,
cognition, mood, and anxiety.

However, a great deal remains unknown about the respective roles and
interactions of heredity, environment, and brain dysfunction. Therefore,
it is prudent to give them somewhat equal consideration.

Every one of us occasionally feels sad or down. It is a normal, healthy
response to adversity. Clinical depression is much more than this; more
than just the "blues". It's a complex mood disorder that affects
Canadians of all ages and stages. This gives us a general notion about
the disease but let's peel back the layers a bit more.

While it can suddenly go into remission, depression is not something
that people can "get over" just by their own will.

How does the family doctor actually diagnose major depressive disorder?
Let's see what it says in the DMS V.

A diagnosis requires a specific cluster of symptoms, at least **5**
present every day and all day. This cluster must last two weeks or more.

Look at the list in the chart on the next slide. One of the first
adjectives that comes to mind is that these are actually quite 'common'
symptoms for all of us. Other than perhaps suicidal thoughts, we can
relate to most of these every once in a while. They are not weird and
wacky symptoms.

At the present time, there is no one scientific test that can
conclusively diagnose a mental disorder.  Researchers using MRI
technology have found differences in the brain in individuals who have
experienced severe mental disorders over the long-term but medical
imaging cannot be used yet to conclusively diagnose mental disorders at
this time.

However, just because we can't yet detect mental disorders using simple
medical tests, doesn't mean physiological changes aren't occurring. 
Some of us have heard the term, "chemical imbalance" used to describe
depression and other mental disorders.  What's really imbalanced?  Let's
look at one model to how it really works according to medical science.

**Major depressive disorder – how does it work?**

To help us better understand how mental disorders work, let's explore a
little further. Broadly speaking, our brain is made of 3 major areas;
the Primitive Brain, the Limbic System and Prefrontal Cortex.

When a brain is functioning well, information is transmitted
electrically from neuron to neuron across gaps from the Primitive Brain,
through the limbic system, to the prefrontal cortex. This is done with
the help of bio-chemicals called neurotransmitters. This process allows
us to think clearly and to process our emotions.

Neurotransmitters are hormones that transmit information through our
brains and bodies, helping to regulate such things as pleasure, pain,
thought, and mood.  Serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine
are the names of these neurotransmitters that affect our mood and
emotion.  Mental disorders such as major depressive disorder are
believed to be a function of an imbalance - too many or too few
neurotransmitters.

Medication is designed to influence the brain to restore the chemical
balance, enabling the neurotransmitters to work properly.

If there is a problem with these neurotransmitters, the thought process
can be compromised. Thoughts get stuck in the Primitive Brain and the
Limbic system, leaving the person in a stress response, locked in
emotion. They are unable to access the executive centre to deal with the
situation constructively. This chemical imbalance is believed to
contribute significantly to the development of mental disorders. The
situation can also be thought of as a 'wiring' problem. It is NOT about
a weak character as our stigmatized view suggests.

Here is a brief overview of the 3 parts of the brain discussed above:

Primitive Brain - This is where the stress response occurs.

Limbic System - This is where we process our feelings and emotions.

Prefrontal cortex - This is where our logic and decision making occurs.

**Major depressive disorder**

An example in action – the brain's response

Imagine the following scenario:

You slept through your alarm and are late leaving the house for work. 
You get into your car, turn the key in the ignition and find that your
car won't start. Most of us would experience distress at this moment -
frustration, anger or worry, as our stress hormones (adrenalin and
cortisol) flood our nervous system. Here is what the person's inner
dialogue might sound like.

"Oh no! The car won't start. This is bad!" - This is the STRESS RESPONSE
from the Primitive, hot part of the brain. "I can't believe it happened
today, on a day I was already behind!" - This is the mid-brain reacting
with frustration and emotion - still a hot part of the brain.

"Well, I've got to get to work – what can I do?. Maybe Chris hasn't left
for work yet and he could pick me up." This is the executive centre 
doing the PROBLEM SOLVING – the pre-frontal cortex – the  calm, cool,
collected part of the brain.

This is how the brain is supposed to work. Alerted to the need for
action by stress and fueled by emotion, we take action based on a cool
analysis of options.

Let's see what it is like when a person is experiencing an imbalance of
neurotransmitters (Major Depressive Disorder or Anxiety).

When a person is experiencing an imbalance of neurotransmitters (Major
Depressive Disorder or Anxiety) , they might have a different
experience. They might feel the impact of the stress hormones and the
consequent emotions, but the bio-chemical messages that alleviate the
stress response might not kick in as expected in the prefrontal cortex,
making it difficult for the person to calm down enough to think clearly.
The person might feel so overwhelmed, they simply give up and call in
sick.

From an outside point of view it might seem like this person lacks
problem-solving smarts, willpower or is just lazy. The person
him/herself might even experience self-depreciating thoughts and shame
over the inability to act. However, what's really happening is that the
brain is not fully functioning and are preventing him/her from being
able to think and act as a healthy person would.

**Generalized anxiety disorder**

The second most frequently diagnosed mental disorder is Generalized
Anxiety Disorder. This disorder is about worry gone overboard.

**A "Disorder"** it is a type of uneasiness or panic that is severe,
long lasting, and interferes with work and with relationships.

Examples include: Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, and
Social Phobias.

Worry helps us to stay healthy **–** as it reminds us to be cautious in
the face of dangers.

worry prepares for challenges and it motivates us to solve everyday
problems.

Sometimes, however, worry can dominate every day and situation. This is
what happens when one's biochemistry or wiring is out of balance.

**The most common symptoms include:**

- Heart rate changes, respiratory difficulties, digestive aches and
  pains, headaches, vision changes, tingling or numbness in the
  extremities, and the person finds it very difficult to control the
  worry.

The DSM 5 lists the following symptoms for Generalized Anxiety Disorder:

- The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause significant distress or
  impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
  functioning.
- The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
  substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical
  condition.
- The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder.

**Adjustment disorder**

Adjustment Disorder is the third most frequently diagnosed mental
disorder and it can often be seen in the workplace. This type of
disorder is different than Depression or Anxiety as it is always related
to a **stressful** triggering event and not necessarily a wiring
problem.

- The symptoms must clearly follow significant stress. The symptoms
  should be more severe than would be expected.
- There should not appear to be other underlying disorders. The symptoms
  that are present are not part of a normal grieving for the death of a
  family member or other loved one.
- Symptoms do not resolve themselves within 6 months of termination of
  stressor.
- The cause of the stress is understandable and known.

All of the disorders in this category relate to a significantly more
difficult adjustment to a life situation than would normally be expected
considering the circumstances.  For example, it is common to need months
and perhaps even years to feel normal again after the loss of a
long-time spouse. However, when this loss causes significant problems
for an abnormal length of time it may be considered an adjustment
disorder; that is, the person is having difficulty adjusting back to
life after the stress or trauma.

- Most of the common symptoms of Adjustment Disorder are very similar to
  the symptoms of depression. As with Depression, most people can get
  back on their feet after treatment.
- Often, the recommended treatment for adjustment disorder is talking
  therapy, such as **Cognitive Behavioural Therapy**. The goal of
  psychotherapy is symptom relief and behavior change.

For any of us who might suffer from a mental disorder or excess stress,
there are many resources to help us recover and cope.

**Recap**

Mental health disorders have earned the status of the fastest growing
cause of disability on a global scale.  Mental disorders are treatable
and stress is manageable.   Early treatment is critical for a successful
recovery.  Mental health conditions can be treated in a variety of ways
including medication, talking therapy, and community support aimed at
achieving positive mental health.  It is important to remember that
diagnosis must be left to mental health professionals.

New medications have positively impacted the lives of people living with
mental disorders. Specific medications are used to treat specific
illnesses. For example, depression is treated with antidepressant
medications, which support the neurotransmitters in the brain.

Talking therapy, commonly used in conjunction with medication, allows
individuals to dialogue with a mental health professional with the goal
of assisting with healthy change in behavior. This can help train our
brains as well.

As we have seen, mental health plays a big part in how we live our
lives.  Remember, you can be mentally healthy even if you have had a
mental health disorder; that is, you can be completely functional with
the appropriate treatment and recovery. No one is immune to mental
health issues, including some of the best performing employees.  Even
when suffering, a person can still contribute at home and at work.  And
although stress is not a mental health disorder, it can put a heavier
strain on a person struggling with a mental disorder.

Remember, stigma is a barrier to progress. Education and responding to
stigma in the workplace will help to remove this barrier.

Let's conclude by considering the case of a colleague, named Gustav.

**Gustav's story – part 2**

Gustav has worked for the company for 10 years, and he has consistently
held up his end as a member of the team.

Lately you have noticed some changes in his behaviour. He's been more
argumentative and stubborn in meetings for example, but you tell
yourself, it's not really your business to say anything to him, you are
just his peer.

You consider talking to your Manager about it but you're not sure if
that's the right thing to do either.

**Question 1**

The team notices that Gustav's behaviour is continuing. As a result, the
team responds by talking amongst themselves and speculating as to what
might be going on with Gustav. Since you seem to be the only person at
work that he still seems to trust, the team has asked you to talk to him
and find out what is going on. You find a private moment to discuss this
with Gustav.

**How do you begin this conversation?**

1.  Let me cut right to the chase Gustav. You have been difficult to
    deal with lately. What's going on?

2.  I have some personal feedback for you and I'm wondering if you are
    open to hearing it? (and wait for an OK to proceed)

3.  Everybody on the team is concerned for you and we feel like you are
    shutting us out. You've been in such a negative mood lately that
    it's really getting to us. I've been chosen to say something to you.
    So . . .?

**When you are ready, continue reading to get the correct answer.**

The correct answer is B). The best option is to respectfully ask for
permission to offer negative feedback before delivering it. If we
accuse, blame or negatively judge Gustav initially, we are likely to
provoke a natural defensiveness, which will undermine our attempts to
learn more or to support him.

**If you chose a different answer:**

The best option is to respectfully ask for permission to offer negative
feedback before delivering it. If we accuse, blame or negatively judge
Gustav initially, we are likely to provoke a natural defensiveness,
which will undermine our attempts to learn more or to support him.
Asking aggressive questions will also predictably trigger a defensive or
even offensive reply from Gustav.

**Question 2**

Gustav says he is willing to talk to you about what is going on with him
after you ask for permission. He tells you that he hasn't been able to
get a good night's sleep for months and it's taking a toll on his
energy, patience, and enjoyment of life.

**How do you respond?**

1.  Be a good listener and try to put yourself in his shoes.  Try to
    understand what he is going through and then let him know that you
    understand how tough it must be.
2.  Immediately telling him that he should get some professional help.
    This isn't normal and he needs to take action.
3.  Say to him “Well that's not really an excuse for your attitude
    around here lately. No matter what you're going through, the team
    wants you to be easier to get along with. OK?

**When you are ready, continue reading to get the correct answer.**

The correct answer is A). The best option is to be a good listener, and
try to put yourself in his shoes for a minute, to understand what he is
going through and then letting him know that you understand how tough it
must be. By pushing Gustav to take action we may be inviting him to push
right back, and tell us to mind our own business.

**If you chose a different answer:**

The best option is to be a good listener, and try to put yourself in his
shoes for a minute, to understand what he is going through and then
letting him know that you understand how tough it must be. By pushing
Gustav to take action we may be inviting him to push right back, and
tell us to mind our own business. By putting demands on Gustav to
change, we make the conversation about our needs versus truly supporting
Gustav.

**Question 3**

Gustav acknowledges that it has been very tough on him to go so long
without proper sleep. He confirms that you do seem to understand what
he's going through.

**How do you support Gustav?**

1.  You can say, "It's hard to know what to do sometimes. What options
    have you considered?"
2.  You can ask, "Have you talked to your family doctor about this? I
    imagine he or she might be helpful."
3.  You can say, "I can only imagine what you've been going through.
    Have you considered reaching out to the Employee Family Assistance
    Program? They have professionals there to help us when we have
    concerns and can help us get back on track. It's confidential and
    free of charge."
4.  Any of the above

**When you are ready, continue reading to get the correct answer.**

The correct answer is D) There are many ways to be supportive. We can
offer a choice of options to Gustav, which is respectful of him. We
don't want to use a "hard sell", but rather offer options, invite Gustav
to consider the possible ways he might get professional help to resolve
his condition. Our job as a caring colleague can be to build a bridge
for our teammates to get the help they need – it is not to be their
doctor or counsellor or manager.

**If you chose a different answer:**

You are right, that would be helpful. But, so are the other responses.
There are actually many ways to be supportive. When we offer a choice of
options to Gustav, it is respectful of him. We don't want to use a "hard
sell", but rather offer options, invite Gustav to consider the possible
ways he might get professional help to resolve his condition. Our job as
a caring colleague, can be to build a bridge for our teammates to get
the help they need – it is not to be their doctor or counsellor

**Module 3 – Strategies for Mental Health Resiliency**

**Learning objectives**

At the end of this module, you will be able to:

-  discover basic techniques to strengthen resilience to mental health
issues, and -  learn strategies for building personal resiliency

**Why resiliency?**

Building your personal resiliency is an important piece of the puzzle
when it comes to staying healthy and safe on the job. Resiliency refers
to someone's ability to cope.

The healthier a person is psychologically, emotionally, and physically,
the more successful they will be when faced with life's demands, stress,
and adversity.

**A resilient person is someone who:**

- remains calm and copes well under pressure,
- has confidence in themselves,
- is capable of setting limits and boundaries, and
- takes time for themselves

**Building your resiliency**

Below are the **4 strategies** for building your personal resiliency

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Connect**

Here are some important strategies for building resiliency by connecting
with others:

- Develop strong connections with persons who care. These could include
  family, friends, spiritual connections, and support groups
- Spend time with people who make you happy
- Seek help or support when needed, and
- Communicate about what you need

**Cope**

Here are healthy self-care strategies:

- Exercise regularly
- Get regular sleep
- Eat a good nutritious diet
- Take time for yourself and have fun
- Don't overdo it. Set boundaries for yourself

**Adapt**

- Reduce daily stressors and build your adaptive capabilities
- Find your natural coping mechanisms and use them more
- Practise relaxation and deep-breathing techniques
- Don't sweat the small stuff. Maintain perspective
- Humour can help you adapt in stressful situations
- Find the parts of the problem you can manage. "Let go" of the parts
  that are out of your control
- Maintain a positive outlook
- Practice self-talk to maintain confidence, and
- Say "no" when you need to

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Know**

- Know when you can care for yourself and when you need care from others
- Recognize your personal stress signs and stress triggers
- Accept yourself and the fact that you are vulnerable
- Know when to delegate
- Keep things in perspective
- Get help if you experience negative changes in behaviour

**Strengthening your resiliency**

Below are some basic approaches to strengthening your resilience to
mental health issues and lapses into mental health distress:

- Develop healthy habits like getting enough rest, good nutrition,
  hydration
- Get regular exercise and stress management
- Regular exercise and stress management
- Strengthen family relationships and social ties
- Take scheduled breaks in your day including a break from work
- Nurture a hopeful, optimistic and confident outlook about the future
  and yourself, and
- Keep things in perspective

**Summary**

That's it. As you can see, building and strengthening mental resilience
through a balanced lifestyle plays a key role in helping us cope with
adversities and stress, which could lead to a mental health issue.

Key points to remember for building resiliency include:

- coping,
- connection,
- knowing yourself and your limits, and
- adapting to reduce stress

**Review**

In this module, you discovered:

- basic techniques to strengthening resilience to mental health issues,
  and
- strategies for building personal resiliency

You have come to the end of this module.

**Module 4 - Resources**

**Learning objectives**

At the end of this module, you will be able to:

-  discover resources and support to find assistance when dealing with
mental health issues

**Ways your organization can help**

Organizations are becoming increasingly aware of the need to take the
issue of mental health seriously and lend help and support where
appropriate while respecting people's privacy.

As a preventative measure, organizations are keeping a close watch on
the health and well-being of their employees by trying to maintain a
healthy work environment.

Organizations are equipping leaders with the training and tools to
recognize unusual and unexplained changes in their employees'
behaviours.

Early intervention is important.

Having a conversation with your manager, leader, or HR representative
about a condition you may be experiencing may help in a faster recovery
to a healthier mental state. Accommodation and empathy are factors
workplaces are putting in place to help avoid a "slip" into an impaired
mental health state.

Support and referral to resources that provide additional services may
also be helpful before the need for a mental health related disability
occurs.

Please do not attempt to diagnose yourself or others. If you suspect a
problem, please consult with a qualified doctor.

**Ways to help others**

Should you wish to provide support and be there for someone, here are
some general guidelines:

- Be respectful and maintain confidentiality. Consider how you would
  like to be approached if you were in the same situation.
- Find a time and place to talk that is mutually convenient and private.
- Keep questions open-ended and supportive. Listen with empathy. Allow
  the person space to talk. Let them know that "your door is always
  open" if they need to talk.
- Offer support. Remind the person about availability of resources.
- Most importantly, do not assume or judge. Do ask the person how they
  are feeling, but do not say "what happened to you?" Instead, say "I
  have noticed that you…" and describe what you have observed.

**Where to find help?**

While recovering from a mental health disorder, it is important to get
support and to maintain some social contact – this aids in recovery. 
There are many resources that can help provide support.

Your organization has invested in resources to support you on the job.
Your family, friends, physician, including psychiatrist and therapists,
can support you in your personal life. There are also resources in your
community that are available to you.
