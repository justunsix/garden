title: Social Media Rules for Groups

Example rules for digital groups like Facebook groups

1 Check the search bar

Searching your question prior to posting means you can expand the
conversation on a post that already exists. It keeps things streamlined
and easier to navigate.

2 Be Kind and Courteous

We're all in this together to create a welcoming environment. Let's
treat everyone with respect. Healthy debates are natural, but kindness
is required.

3 No Hate Speech or Bullying

We will not allow any offensive, discriminatory, unlawful or threatening
comments in the group. Trolling, bullying, name-calling, hate speech,
and abuse of any sort will not be tolerated.

4 Promotion posts LIMIT once per month or not permitted

A Member businessâ€”owners, business pages, and members: one sales &
advertising post per month. Includes referral links. No restriction when
commenting and your business is relevant to the topic.

5 No Spam

Spam, marketing, and irrelevant content are not allowed. Review our
About section for acceptable content. Admins will give warnings or
remove immediately, depending on the circumstance.

6 Not a buy/sell/trade/free group

We support the circular economy, but this group is not a
buy/sell/trade/free group.

7 Follow the rules

If any posts or comments are deemed inappropriate, we have the right to
delete posts and comments at our discretion and block any repeat
offenders. You may also use the "Report to Admin" button.
