## Introduction to Power Automate and Flows - Module 1

Power Platform Automate is an online platform for automation of business
processes using:

- Friendly user interface (UI), API, and artificial intelligence
  automation

- Power Automate Flows - access at <https://make.powerautomate.com/>

  - Built on Azure logic apps platforms
  - Use connectors to data sources and platforms, triggers, actions
  - Start with templates
  - High availability
  - Can be shared

### Example Use Cases

- Deal with emails, receive notifications
- Tasks management
- Copy email attachments to OneDrive
- Collect business data and share with others
- Approval workflows

### Where to create and administer flows?

- UI in browser, mobile friendly
- AI Builder - everything inside in Power Automate, no additional Azure
  services needed
  - Built on Azure Cognitive services
  - Can build AI parts to include in flows

### Making Flows

1.  Flows

    1.  Types

        - Cloud
          - Good for automated, scheduled, process automation
          - Build on website
        - Desktop
          - Automation of tasks on desktop, like recorded flows, robotic
            process automation
          - Good for legacy applications, desktop only services without
            APIs
          - Build using Power Automate Desktop application
        - Business process
          - Good for case management, staged processes
          - Guide for people to get work done flowing a business process

        Flows can be build on web, desktop, mobile app, and in Teams.

    2.  Components

        - Trigger - When to start a flow? event that starts the flow
          - Automated - when something happens
          - Schedule - always on a certain regular time
          - Instant
          - Notifications
          - Approvals
          - Mobile
        - Actions - 1 or more steps that are run
        - Connectors - connect cloud flows to apps, services, data
          - Standard - ex. Office365 licensed, SharePoint
          - Premium - expanded set like Dataverse, SQL, Azure services
          - Custom - good for APIs, other data sources

2.  Desktop Interface

    Install with:
    <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/desktop-flows/install>

    - Drag and drop steps

3.  Web Interface

    Access <https://make.powerautomate.com/>

    - Action items for you
    - Create flows, for example from templates
    - Connectors - Manage connectors, find new ones
    - Data - data sources
    - Other options
      - AI Builder
      - Learning

### Demo: Create flow from Template

- Access <https://make.powerautomate.com/> on web on desktop
- Make a save office 365 email attachments to OneDrive flow
- Reuse template: "save Office 365 email attachments to specified
  OneDrive for Business folder"
- In the flow template, it shows required connections you have to enable
  like email and OneDrive
- Modify template, can add your name to the "To list" so only on emails
  to you
- See template saves files to OneDrive under default folder email
  attachments from Power Automate
- Can check flow using Flow Checker and Test functionality in UI
- Test by sending an email to yourself with an attachment
- Check flow status under "My flows" to see if steps ran and they did

1.  Create from Mobile

    - Install Power Automated app on Android
    - Use button flow
    - Create a flow "Send myself a reminder in 10 minutes"
    - Manually trigger flow, time delay, send push notification
    - Can invite others to own flow and share
    - Can see flows and history

### Dynamic Content in Power Automate

Creating flows from scratch

- Example, when a record is created in data source, send an email based
  on record content added
- For this example, create the flow from a template "get a push
  notification when you get an emailâ€¦"
- In flow, change email to field to you
- Note in get manager task in flow uses get your profile and gets your
  manager based on your user principal name
- Condition to check email gets email from the original email, your
  manager and compares them
  - Yes: you get a push notification
  - No: do nothing

### Expressions in Power Automate

May need to evaluate, calculate using the data (dynamic content) in the
flow. Use with open **Dynamic Content** menu and then select
**Expression**

1.  Demo: Manually Trigger a Flow

    - Create new flow on manual trigger
    - Add inputs:
      - Square Footage: Number
      - Cost: Number
    - Add "compose" data operation, called "Compose"
      - For inputs, use Expression: multiply with the dynamic content,
        square footage and cost:
        `mul(triggerBody()?['SquareFootage'], triggerBody()?['Cost'])`
    - Add "compose" data operation, called "Compose 2"
      - As input, use output from earlier compose operation
      - As output, use format number:
        `formatNumber(outputs('Compose'), 'C2')`
        - C2 = currency format
    - Save and test where you enter 2 inputs and get a formatted
      currency result

## Introduction to Business Process Flows - Module 2

### When to Use Business Process Flows

1.  Differences from Business Process Flows and Power Automate Flows

    | Business Processes              | Power Automate                           |
    |---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
    | Visual Guide                    | No visual guide                          |
    | Dataverse only                  | Not restricted to Dataverse              |
    | No time limit                   | Steps based on data and user interaction |
    | Standardized, logical branching | Complex logic, call other flows          |

2.  Benefits of Business Process Flows

    - Consistent stage and work steps
    - Data collection and reporting
    - Better time and results due to standardization, guidance

### Why Use Each Flow
