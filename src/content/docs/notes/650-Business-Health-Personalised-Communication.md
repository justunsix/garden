Source: Article from Canada Life "The Art of Personalised Communication
in Health Care"

Your individual traits, like your genes, lifestyle, and personal
choices, affect your health experiences. An all-in-one approach that
doesn't consider these differences can often fail to meet your needs
properly.

How you interact and speak with your health care professional can
significantly influence the care that you receive. If there's a lack of
clear communication, it can result in misunderstandings and lead to
inappropriate or suboptimal treatments. That's why knowing how to
effectively communicate with your health care provider is a key part of
personalising your health care.

If you have issues that you've had trouble discussing with your doctor,
nurse practitioner, pharmacist, or other people in your circle of care,
try these strategies at your next appointment:

## Be Prepared

Before any appointments, make a list of all the symptoms, concerns, and
questions you have. A clear list can keep your conversation focused and
ensure all your concerns are addressed. If you get stuck while making
your list of questions, consider including some of the following:

- Can you explain my health problem to me in simple terms?
- What are the different ways we can tackle my health issue, and which
  ones do you suggest?
- Are there any side effects that could come with the medication or
  treatment?
- What changes can I make in my usual habits or activities to better my
  health?
- Do I need to schedule a follow-up visit, and if so, when?
- How can I connect with you if I have more questions?

## Speak Up

Remember, it's your health at stake. If you're unsure or uncomfortable
about anything, ask your provider. They are there to help you. Never shy
away from asking questions or voicing your opinions.

If you feel nervous, writing your thoughts down first can help put those
words clearer in our mind and make them easier to say. Other people in
your community, whether they're close friends, relatives, social
workers, or medical interpreters, can join you during your appointment
and help you to voice your thoughts and concerns.

## Be Honest

It's important to provide a complete and truthful medical history to
your health care provider. This can include information about your diet,
physical activity, medication use, and family history. An open and
thorough discussion about your health can help to create treatment plans
that are tailored to your unique needs.

personalise your health care experiences.
