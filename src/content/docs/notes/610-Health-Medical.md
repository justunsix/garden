## Sport and Life Balance

**As an elite athlete, can you really have a sport-life balance?**

April 8, 2015 - IOC Live Web event

As a veteran of four Olympic Games and currently in training for Rio
2016, it's easy to assume record-breaking swimmer Kirsty Coventry's
training schedule must dominate her life.Â  But looking at her many
achievements outside of her sporting career, it's clear Kirsty has
combined success within and beyond her sport.

In 2000, while still in high school, Kirsty became the first Zimbabwean
swimmer to reach the semi-finals at the Olympic Games. Since then she
has gained a degree, become an IOC Athletes' Commission member and
created a water safety academy; as well as becoming a two-time Olympic
champion and seven-time world champion.

### Tips

- Take time to absorb success, celebrate
- Have a support network - parents, family, friends
- Separate work/training from home, family, friends.
- Have a mentor
- Have a focus outside of your work
- Ensuring you rest, maintaining good health. It is ok to take rest and
  take things slower!
- Developing a post career plan:
- Find passion related to sport
- Additional training may be required, preparation
- Talking with people in the sport for ideas
