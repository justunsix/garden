In this module, we consider the effectors of the body that govern
voluntary and involuntary movement. These effectors are specialized
cells called muscle which are capable of generating force (tension).
Muscle cells are classified as one of three types: skeletal, smooth, and
cardiac. Although all three types generate tension, each is specialized
for a given function. Skeletal muscle governs voluntary movement of the
limbs and is critical for expansion of the lung during breathing. Smooth
and cardiac muscle are contractile cells found in the walls of blood
vessels and the heart, respectively. We will return to the basic
principles that govern these cells types when we consider the
respiratory and cardiovascular systems.

## Muscle

### Muscle types

- Nuclei are visible in these microscope images

- Skeletal muscles are striated. Muscle cells (aka fibres) are large in
  diameter and maybe length since they run the length of a muscle. The
  muscle cells will be multiple nuclei (they have more than one nuclei)
  and nuclei are usually at edges. Controlled by somatic NS

- Cardiac are also striated, small and contain 1-2 nuclei, connected by
  specialized junctions. Controlled by Autonomic NS

- Smooth muscle is present in many organs. They are not striated and
  have junctions. Controlled by Autonomic NS

### Shared Principles of skeletal, cardiac, smooth muscle types

- The sliding filament mechanism, in which myosin filaments bind to and
  move actin filaments, is the basis for shortening of stimulated
  muscle.

- Myosin and actin interactions are regulated by calcium ions.

- Changes in the membrane potential lead to contraction; cell E-C
  coupling (excitation-contraction coupling)

 

### Skeletal muscle cross section and zoomed in layers

- Skeletal muscle has many - muscle cells/fibers which has many -
  myobrils

- Myobrils are divided into sarcomeres in series. Number of myobrils
  determine force generation capability.

- Sarcomere patterns cause the striations.

 

### Electron micrograph of a single Sarcomere Structure

Part of a myofibril  

- Sarcomeres have a light and dark pattern.

- Z lines are ends of sarcomeres

- Thin filaments are actin

- Thick filaments are myosin. Note myosin is surrounding the centre of
  the sarcomere. Myosin moves along the actin towards the Z lines. This
  movement like walking moves the myosin and actin together.

- A band (think dark has letter "A") = thick colour (myosin is thick)

- I (eye) band (think light has the letter "I") = light colour (actin)

 

- Relaxed -\> Contracted : I band is reduced in width in contraction
  while A band is staying the same.

- Sarcomere becomes shorter.

- A band is the length of the myosin (red) and I band disappears since
  myosin and actin are together. The amount of actin that is alone is
  minimal in a contracted muscle.

 

### Regulation by Calcium

How is the contraction occurring through Calcium?

 

- Top of diagram is actin

- Tropomyosin is parallel to actin. Without Ca, tropomyosin prevents
  actin and myosin from binding

- Troponin with Ca, allows myosin to bind with actin.

- Bottom of diagram shows myosin/actin binding

 

### Cross Bridge Cycling

 

- Actin and myosin are bound.

- Myosin provides ATPase

- **Rigor state** is when myosin is tightly bound to actin with no ATP.

  - Examaple: It is the same state a dead person would be in since all
    ATP is quickly used up (rigor mortis). Eventually proteins of the
    muscle will break down removing the rigor state.

- ATP causes the myosin head to walk up closer to the Z line along the
  actin.

  - Myosin head lets go of actin and ratchets forward, and phosphates
    are released causing a "power stroke".

  - ATP is released

- Return rigor state. Cycle continues.

- Why doesn't the myosin slip back to a relaxed state when the head
  let's go? there are many myosin heads in the muscle and they will be
  in different stages, so other heads will be in myosin-actin bound
  states during muscle contraction.

 

What is needed for contraction?

- Calcium

- ATP

 

### Linking Somatic NS to Muscle contraction - Excitation-Contraction (E-C) Coupling

 

1.  Somatic neuron sends a branch of the axon to synapse on skeletal
    muscle.

2.  Neuron releases ACh given a graded potential. Ach will bind
    nicotinic ACh receptors on skeletal muscle plasma membrane

3.  Na+ will enter membrane = graded potential. Small graded potential
    will cause an action potential since there are many Na+, K+ voltage
    gate channels on the membrane.

4.  Action potentials will travel all over muscle membrane and across
    transverse (T) tubules that transfer the action potential into the
    muscle. Transverse = perpendicular to membrane.

5.  Sarcoplasmic reticulum (S.R.) is close to T tubules. Inside the
    T-tubule is a voltage gate Ca channel called the dihydropyridine
    receptor. The change in the dihydropyridine receptor, changes the
    ryanodine receptor in the S.R. The proteins trigger a release of
    Ca++ in the cytosol.

6.  Ca++ in cytosol binds the Troponin triggering myocin and actin
    binding (tropomyocin is removed).

7.  Sarcoplasmic reticulum (S.R.) - Ca+ ATPase (aka SERCA) pumps Ca++
    back into the S.R. So Ca++ is immediately pumped back in to the S.R.
    to prepare for future relaxation.

 

Myofibrils = grey

T Tubule = yellow, they go into the muscle cells, allowing E-C coupling
coordination

Muscle plasma membrane = top yellow

Sarcoplasmic reticulum (S.R.) = blue, wraps around T tubules and
myofibrils. With E-C coupling, myofibrils are bathed in Ca from S.R.
S.R. can then retake Ca after contraction.

 

### Key Concepts

All muscles are composed of two sets of overlapping protein filaments,
actin and myosin. The relative sliding of which produce shortening and
generates force. This process involves cross bridge formation between
actin and myosin and uses ATP.

 

Couple between the membrane action potentials and contraction is
mediated by calcium ions. Skeletal muscle has an actin-based (thin
filament) control system. Relaxation occurs with the removal of Ca++.

 

## Skeletal Muscle - Tension and Metabolism

### Stimulus Frequency and Tension

 

- AP = action potential

- A twitch is due to a single action potential.

- Ca spikes in cytosol with action potential as it travels the muscle
  membrane.

- ATPase starts to remove Ca from S.R.

- A single action potential causes a single twitch, though tension will
  be small.

- AP duration = 5 milliseconds

- Twitch duration = 100 msec

 

More APs in a row will increase tension by resulting in myocin heads are
walking up actin and increasing tension. Ca levels in cytosol will spike
removing tropomyocin. This process is different in skeletal muscle and
cardiac muscle.

 

### Velocity of Shortening

Shortening Contractions (concentric contraction): For small loads,
tension can remain consistent while muscle shortens for force
generation, (e.g. lift small weights). Isotonic contraction means force
generation by changing length of the muscle only and not tension.

Isometric contractions (maximal load): tension = load

Lengthening contraction (eccentric contraction): Load \> Tension - you
are releasing an object due to its weight or slowing down relaxation of
muscles (e.g. sitting down in a chair with respect to quadriceps)

 

High velocities are possible with high tension and low loads. The
greater the load, the lower the possible velocity of shortening.

 

 

### Length - Tension Relationship

Looking at a sarcomere length in resting muscle:

- When sarcomere are too short-contracted (myocin near Z lines and right
  up against Z lines) or too long-stretched (heads of myocin too far
  away from actin to bind), then % of maximum force is low.

- Good force production is when myocin heads are near actin and have a
  distance to travel to the Z-lines to allow muscle contraction and
  force production (top of diagram where sarcomere are in an in-between
  length).

- Usually human skeleton will constrain the sarcomere lengths to these
  idea sarcomere lengths.

 

 

## Metabolism and Fuels

### What is the source of the ATP?

- ATP is necessary for Ca cycling in muscle.

- Creatine phosphate donates a phosphate to convert ADP to ATP in the
  first seconds of muscle activity, like 100 meter dash. Otherwise
  Creatine phosphate is exhausted

- Anaerobic metabolism (glycolytic) produces ATP and lactid acid using
  glycolysis. Burns glucose and muscle glycogen, like 400 meter dash.

- Aerobic metabolism (oxidate = requires oxygen) produces ATP, CO2, and
  water using oxidative phosphorylation, burns blood glucose, fatty
  acids, like marathon. Can be unlimited store of energy. Low ATP
  production/min.

 

Fuel sources: Glucose, glycogen, fatty acids

 

|                    | Moles of ATP made/min | time        | Running example |
|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Creatine phosphate | 4                     | 8-10s       | 100m sprint     |
| Anearobic          | 2.5                   | 1.5 minutes | 400m run        |
| Aerobic            | 1                     | unlimited   | marathon        |

 

Since the body has a lot of fat, aerobic metabolism can last a long
time.

 

### Fatigue State

 

Contributing factors include:

- Build up of ECF \[K+\] = persistent depolarization of fiber.

  - Not of enough time to get gradient back to resting state. Resting
    membrane potential will be less negative and less sensitive to
    neural stimulation as action potentials (AP) are harder to activate.

- Build up of metabolites which impair SR Ca2+ ATPase and
  troponin-tropomyosin

  - Muscle can't be relaxes as Ca can't be moved into SR

  - Muscle isn't as responsive with troponin-tropomyosin

- Build up of Pi in ICF inhibits cross bridge detachment and slows cross
  bridge cycling

  - Building of inorganic phosphate (Pi) reduced ability of muscle to
    contract quickly.

- Decrease in fuel stores (glycogen, fatty acids, and glucose). This
  factor is usually not the cause of fatigue. Think about it. If fuel is
  completely used up, muscle would go into a rigor state (contracted)
  resulting in muscle damage. Myocin is locked down in actin while
  muscle is trying to be used. Fatigue protects the muscle from this
  state and muscle damage.

### Fiber Types and Motor Units

Most skeletal muscles include all 3 fiber types

 

- Fiber types synapse with specific motor neuron. e.g. slow-oxidative
  neuron synapses with slow-oxidative fiber

- Each motor unit has one type of muscle fiber

- Small motor unit \#1 has fewer fibers = finer movement

- Large motor unit \#2 has more fibers = more tension

- Each fascicle contains more than one motor unit.

 

 

### Recruitment

You want to do a movement. How is it initiated?

1.  Slow-oxidative recruited first for movement = low force but high
    precision and/or long duration

2.  Fast-oxidative-glycolytic recruited next = intermediate force

3.  Fast-glycolytic recruited last = high force tasks of short duration

 

Recruitments can increase, depending on neurons recruited:

- number of fibers

- Force of fibers

>  

 

### Muscle Plasticity

Weight training induce hypertrophy to generate more tension (force).

- Size of muscles are increased, more myofibrils are created.

 

Endurance training induces resistance to fatigue without dramatic
hypertrophy.

- Increases ability to use oxygen

- More capillaries in muscles and mitochondria in oxidative fibres.

 

Training changes relative size of fibers, not number of fibers. You are
born with a certain type of fibre.

 

### Key Concepts

Muscles can shorten at a constant force (isotonic contraction) or
develop force without shortening (isometric contraction). Maximal
velocity of shortening occurs with zero load. Summation of contractions
(tetanus) can occur in skeletal muscle resulting in maximal force. Speed
of contraction is set by the myosin ATPase.

 

The immediate fuel for muscle contraction is ATP which is generated
under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Those muscles with high
requirements for ATP and resistance to fatigue have predominately
aerobic metabolism.

 

## Smooth Muscle

- Involuntary muscles

- Walls of organs and surrounds blood vessels

 

### Shared Principles of Muscles

- Sliding filament mechanism (myosin-actin)

- Regulated by calcium

- Internal Ca++ cell leads to contraction

 

### Smooth muscle fiber

 

2-20um , thin cell

Called smooth muscle since there isn't much AI banding visible.

When contracted, cell looks like a square

 

### Ca++ Regulates Myosin

Increase of intracellular \[Ca++\] -\> Ca++ activates myosin light chain
(MLC) kinase -\> cross bridges formation (contraction coming) \>
contraction with shortening and tension in muscle.

 

Ca++ stored in sacroplasmic reticulum inside cell

 

To initiate relaxation in the cardiac myocyte, Ca++ is removed from the
cytoplasm by:

- Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca ATPase

- Plasma membrance Ca ATPase

- Plasma membrane Na-Ca exchanger

 

### Types of Contraction

Slow myosin ATPase = slow contraction (difference in smooth muscle)

 

Tonic = amount of tension generation is proportional to the stimulus and
sustained over time (e.g. muscles around blood vessels)

Phasic = single contraction followed by relaxation = twitch. Fused
tetanus = tension is phasic

 

### Regulation of Contraction

1.  Mechanically gated channels (stretched walls of muscles) -
    e.g. blood vessels stretched, bringing Ca+

2.  Ligand gate channels (chemical) or receptors

- Autonomic nervous system (NorEPI binding to receptors alpha 1, beta 2)

  - e.g. During an asthma attack, constriction of the bronchiolar smooth
    muscle restricts airflow into and out of the lung. Epinephrine is
    administered to restore air flow. Epinephrine binds to beta-2
    adrenergic receptor, allowing brochi relaxation

- Hormones (e.g. Oxytocin)

- Paracrine agents (e.g. K+, H+)

3.  Voltage gated channels

- Spontaneous pacemaker potentials

###  

### Pacemaker Activity

Packemakers have an unstable resting potential for their uniqueness.

Ca++ voltage channels are open and cause membrane potential to vary

Timed event = periodicity to potential changes

K+ channels are open, resulting in repolarization of the cell (as K
leaves the cell, making the membrane potential negative.

 

### Single Unit & Multi Unit Fibers (non-pacemaker smooth muscle)

 

In single-unit muscles: Certain cells are innervated. Whole sheet is
synchronized. Gap junctions spread the membrane potentials between
neightbouring cells.

(e.g. GI tract, uterus, and small blood vessels like arterioles)

 

In multi-unit muscle: each fiber is innervated. There are few or no gap
junctions. These cells are not activated by stretch receptors (e.g. hair
follicles)

 

### Key Concepts

- Smooth muscle is an involuntary, non-striated (no bands) muscle
  associated with blood vessels and visceral organs.

- Smooth muscle contains overlapping protein myofilaments actin and
  myosin. The relative sliding of which produces shortening and
  generates force. This process involves cross bridge formation between
  actin and myosin which is driven by ATP. - similar to skeletal muscle,
  but slow contraction compared to skeletal muscle

- Coupling between the membrane action potential and contraction is
  mediated by the calcium ions. Ca++ regulates myosin to enable cross
  bridge formation and contraction.

- Smooth muscle is regulated by the autonomic nervous system. Some
  smooth muscle is regulated by stretch (mechanical channels, like blood
  vessels expanding allow Ca+ flow) and/or by paracrine factors

- In pacemaker cells, action potentials are initiated by an influx of
  extracellular Ca++.

- Some smooth muscle exhibits fused tetanus (tension - phasic) and tonic
  contraction. e.g. Tonic - sphincter.

 

## Cardiac Muscle

Involuntary muscle found in heart and vena cava (large veins head to
heart) and pulmonary veins (lung to heart)
