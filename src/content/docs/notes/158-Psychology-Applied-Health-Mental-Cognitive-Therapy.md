## Internal Conservation of praising my teaching skills

CBT Tuesdays

Me: I'm not a good coach, I can't keep the children focused.

Good self:

I see you teaching them new skills and they certain have improved given
their report cards. Every group will have a couple people what have
trouble focusing. Here's what you are doing great: creating details
plans that cater to the class, connecting with each of them, and making
things fun when you can.

Me: I feel like I lose control of the class sometimes

Good self:

You said sometimes, but most of the time and most of the class do listen
and work on the skills. Remember they might be thinking about other
things and you cannot always control that and what is affecting them
that particular day. Remember you see progress in them through your
report card which is evidence of your good coaching.
