TED talks and my notes from them

## Work Life

### How to Get Your Brain to Focus

Source: [How to Get Your Brain to Focus \| Chris Bailey \|
TEDxManchester - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu4Yvq-g7_Y)

Benefits of focus are attention span and getting more ideas and plans.

Research shows brains are not distracted, the root cause is the brain is
over stimulated and wants distraction. Distractions can be new food,
media, people, and experiences.

Practice lowered stimulation, approaching boredom to along the mind to
wander. Less stimulation will make it easier to focus and make
connections. Mind wandering examples could be rhythmic / repetitive
activities and sports. Other tips include reduce disconnect from
technology and accept boring activities.

Concept is similar to diffuse mode in [Learning How to Learn Week 1

Source: [Trebor Scholz: Stuck in the gig economy? Try platform co-ops
instead](https://www.ted.com/talks/trebor_scholz_stuck_in_the_gig_economy_try_platform_co_ops_instead)

Democracy applied to workplaces

Platform co-op advantages:

- Example:

  - House cleaning organization of individual cleaners
    - 70% annual turnover in industry
  - Food co-ops
  - Consumer cooperatives

- Combines old co-op model with digital platform

- Increased pay, stability

- Democratic governance: Workers meet weekly to decide on co-op
  operations and get equal voting:

  - Wages (e.g. 5% commission to organization, 95% to workers)
    - Result is better pay and worker retention
  - Data collection
  - Scaling equality, can scale to large organization or franchised
    network of organizations
  - Shared intellectual property

- Governance is still like a normal company, they hire managers,
  technical staff, but democratic governance.

- Training in finance, management, conflict resolution

- Combats:

  - Unfair work and wages
  - Top-down profit and shareholders
  - Other platform commissions that can be 50% or above in standard gig
    economy
  - Lack of inclusion

- Platform Cooperativism Consortium

  - Supports digital coops globally
  - Examples:
    - Up & Go - cleaning
    - Coop Ride: Driver owned taxi platform - Passengers pay less,
      workers get higher wage
    - FairBNB Coop - Half of commissions go to community
    - Social media cooperative - data owned by users

### 3 secrets of resilient people

Source: [Lucy Hone: 3 secrets of resilient
people](https://www.ted.com/talks/lucy_hone_3_secrets_of_resilient_people?rss=172BB350-0205)

Everyone experiences loss, but how do you cope with the tough moments
that follow? Resilience researcher Lucy Hone shares three hard-won
strategies for developing the capacity to brave adversity, overcome
struggle and face whatever may come head-on with fortitude and grace.

- If you're alive, you have had to deal with tough times. After a
  disaster - you are at higher risk of bad things (mental,
  relationships)

1.  3 Strategies - Resilient people

    1.  1\. Know suffering and "shit" happens

    2.  2\. Tune into what is good

        1.  Know what we can change and what is dangerous. Know what is
            not dangerous and is good
        2.  Saber tooth tiger vs a rainbow. Appreciate the rainbow
        3.  Example, every day think 3 good things very day
        4.  Ask what is helping me and what is harming me when you are
            doing it?
            1.  If harming, let it go
            2.  If helping, do it
            3.  Gives you control

### How to make stress your friend

Source: [Kelly McGonigal: How to make stress your
friend](https://www.ted.com/talks/kelly_mcgonigal_how_to_make_stress_your_friend?language=en)

- Thinking that stress is harmful, is actually more harmful to you.

- Thinking that stress is helpful, is helpful and healthier

  - Stress makes you social - oxytocin

### How not to take things personally?

Source: [How not to take things personally? \| Frederik Imbo \|
TEDxMechelen](https://www.ted.com/talks/frederik_imbo_how_not_to_take_things_personally_mar_2020)

- Aware bad things can happen and have a strategy for it.

  - Strategy 1: Shift focus from me, to we. It's not about me. Look at
    the other person's intention.
  - Strategy 2: It is about me (e.g. doubt, insecurity). There is some
    truth in it. Give yourself empathy and speak up.

- Why do we take things personally? because of our ego - we want to be
  "right"

- Understand you do not need to be right and let it go to be happy

- We have 50,000 thoughts of brain in a day, 10,000 are positive, 40,000
  are negative

### Power of Vulnerability - Brené aka Brene Brown

- Connection can lead to share, fear, and vulnerability
- People who are good a connections have - supported by research:
  - Courage to be imperfect and kind to others
    - Courage = tell story with a whole heart
  - Feel worth of connections
  - "Do something, with no guarantees"
- If we numb vulnerability (for example with addictions), we numb all
  emotions.

Principles to live by

- Love whole hearted
- Gratitude
- We're enough

1.  Listening to Shame

    - Vulnerability is:

      - Emotional risk
      - Measurement of courage
      - Uncertainty which leads to creativity, innovation, and change
      - Birth place of joy, faith, love, belonging
      - **Embrace it with gratitude**

    - Shame: "I'm sorry, I'm bad" - negative self talk

    - Empathy cures shame. Remove secrecy, silence, and judgement to
      cure shame

    - We are becoming intolerant to vulnerability due to perception of
      scarcity and using numbing like addictions and distractions

- Illusion of shortage: survival need, advertising, social pressures
- Asking a question what if you do less? think quality? what is enough?
  - Assess what is important to you
  - Remove other things

### How technology changes our sense of right and wrong

[Juan Enriquez: How technology changes our sense of right and
wrong](https://www.ted.com/talks/juan_enriquez_how_technology_changes_our_sense_of_right_and_wrong)

Exponential advances in technology are leading to more ethical behavior.
As times changes, what is "right" and "wrong" changes. In history, for
example:

- Human sacrifice
- Human execution
- Slavery
- Gay marriage
- Meating eating and vegetarianism (in future)

Remember humility and forgiveness when looking back in the past. Don't
build psychological "trenches" (like World War 1 black or white) - build
empathy instead.

### Be humble and other lessons from the philosophy of water

- [Raymond Tang: Be humble and other lessons from the philosophy of
  water](https://www.ted.com/talks/raymond_tang_be_humble_and_other_lessons_from_the_philosophy_of_water)

From Taoism water poem, 3 learnings from water's nature:

- Humility - humbly nurture others
- Harmony - water always finds a solution, doesn't get angry, flows
  around rocks, don't focus on things you don't control
  - Instead of growth, focus on harmony
- Open - Being
- "H2O", "what would water do?"

"Black Swan", "Grey Rhino"

Your personal Outlook - for example people that plan for their deaths vs
Those that do not

Why do some people deal with things and some not?

- Support system: will govt, family, society support if I fail?
- Risk tolerance: will someone help me if I fall?

### What I learned from 2,000 obituaries

fear and
faith](https://www.ted.com/talks/ingrid_betancourt_what_six_years_in_captivity_taught_me_about_fear_and_faith)

1.  Live by principles
2.  Unity
3.  Have faith - transforms you

Rise above fear and choose how you react to it

### Your brain on video games

Source: [Your brain on video games \| Daphne
Bavelier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FktsFcooIG8)

Games can have positive effects, as tested in lab. Same with wine
research - manageable amounts can be helpful (Binging is never good).

1.  Lab findings

    1.  Vision is better

        - Action gamers can determine small details in clutter better.
          \> E.g. reading fine print, colour differentiation

        <figure>
        <img src="../media/Learning-TED-image3.png" />
        <figcaption>Text Description automatically generated</figcaption>
        </figure>

    2.  Attention, awareness

        - Colour/meaning conflicts are resolved faster by action gamers
        - Ability to track objects and remember - e.g. environmental
          scan while driving

        <figure>
        <img src="../media/Learning-TED-image4.png" />
        <figcaption>A picture containing diagram Description automatically
        generated</figcaption>
        </figure>

        - Areas that affect attention are more efficient for action game
          players

    3.  Multi-tasking

        - Action game players are better at changing focus
        - High multi../media taskers (listening to music, searching) are
          actually not effective at multitasking

        Lab research: pretest, have people play action games, have them
        tested again, test again after couple month. We discovered
        positive effects last.

## Physical Health

### Sleep is your superpower

[Matt Walker: Sleep is your
superpower](https://www.ted.com/talks/matt_walker_sleep_is_your_superpower#t-1146003)

Sleep is required for life and key to learning, health, and feeling
younger. Not enough sleep causes many health problems. Research shows
negative outcomes for daylight saving time changes and less sleep
results in negative body changes, learning performance, and disease.

1.  Sleep regularly and enough
2.  Keep a cooler bedroom temperature (around 65 F, 18 C)
3.  Avoid stimulants and drugs (for example coffee, alcohol) at night
4.  If staying awake in bed too long, go to other place for a while

### Find your primal posture and sit without back pain

Gokhale at

- Have your pelvic "tail" behind you instead of "sitting on it". Don't
  slouch but keep pelvis/butt sticking out at the back

- "J"spin, behind sticks out

### Your body language may shape who you are

[Amy Cuddy: Your body language may shape who you
are](https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_may_shape_who_you_are#t-4684)

Body language affects how others see us, but it may also change how we
see ourselves. Social psychologist Amy Cuddy shows how "power posing" —
standing in a posture of confidence, even when we don't feel confident —
can affect testosterone and cortisol levels in the brain, and might even
have an impact on our chances for success. (Note: Some of the findings
presented in this talk have been referenced in an ongoing debate among
social scientists about robustness and reproducibility. Read Amy Cuddy's
response under "Learn more" below.)

## Non-verbal cues

### Pride

<figure>

<figcaption>A person running on a track</figcaption>
</figure>

### High and low power

<figure>
<img src="../media/Learning-TED-image6.png" />
<figcaption>A person wearing a suit and tie Description automatically
generated with low confidence</figcaption>
</figure>

We know non-verbals govern our behaviour and perceptions.

Minds change our bodies, body can change minds.

Physiological differences in "confident people" - can be increased.

- Animal alpha males: high testosterone (assertive, aggressive) and \>
  low cortisol (low stress reaction)

### Factors?

- Women more likely to have low power body shapes

- Fake it until you make it

Be small

Are we faking it if we use these poses to get to places?

"Fake it until you become it - internalize it"

Small things lead to big changes. Two minutes of power poses to push
