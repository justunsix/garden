  locally](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2338922/5-easy-ways-to-run-an-llm-locally.html) -
  Details on options and their software features

Advantages of local AI:

- Consistency
- Works offline and not tied to service changes
- Privacy
- Cost

Software for local AI

- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (available for Mac, Windows and Linux
  operating systems) lets users download open models, including Llama
  3.1, Phi-3, Mistral and Gemma 2, and access them through a command
  line
  - Model downloads are easy
  - Integration with LangChain, PrivateGPT
- [GPT4All](https://www.nomic.ai/gpt4all) cross platform app
  - Chat like GUI
  - Can chat with own local documents
  - Download models
  - Integration with CLI, local server API like OpenAI API, Python, Node
- [Llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile), which can
  transform LLMs into a single file that runs on several operating
  systems, with or without a graphics processing unit
  - Single executable LLM files
  - Supports GGUF format for import and run
  - Chat in browser
- [LLM](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/) by Simon Willison
  - CLI, requires Python installed
    - CLI customization
  - Uses OpenAI models and reuse gpt4all ones
- [h2oGPT](https://h2o.ai/) - good for advanced users
  - Chat GUI
  - Local documents chat
  - Model configuration
- [PrivateGPT](https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT) /
  [LocalGPT](https://github.com/PromtEngineer/localGPT) - query own
  local documents
  - "PrivateGPT features scripts to ingest data files, split them into
    chunks, create “embeddings” (numerical representations of the
    meaning of the text), and store those embeddings in a local Chroma
    vector store. When you ask a question, the app searches for relevant
    documents and sends just those to the LLM to generate an answer."
  - Requires Python

### Additional Options

- [Jan](https://jan.ai/) - Model download, RAG
- Opera browser (developer stream) - local AI option
- NVIDIA [Chat with
  RTX](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-on-rtx/chat-with-rtx-generative-ai/) -
  Chat, RAG
- [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)
  - Hugging Face as model source
  - Good GUI, can use own data
  - API same as OpenAI
- [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) - framework for creating
  generative AI applications
