- Focus on important things to you and what makes you happy, provides
  value
- Be conscious of addictions, unhealthy images, consumerism that can be
  promoted by advertising, society. Understand symbolism of consumption
  rather than actual benefit of things.
  - Need to be aware of compulsive consumption - consumption itself is
    not bad.
  - Be cautious of social perceptions about fashion, technology use
- A certain amount of money is correlated to happiness to provide
  safety, shelter.

### Positive Considerations

- Make living space for what you need
- Make time and space (physical and mental) for people, yourself
  providing freedom
- Connect in the present, mindful:
  - Meditation -"Makes me 10% happier" -Dan Harris
- Balance
  - Having enough
  - Love people, community
