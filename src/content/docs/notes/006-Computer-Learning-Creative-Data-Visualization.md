## Data Visualization and Digital Services

Source: My personal notes from session with Ontario Digital Service

Why visualize data? improved analysis (insights, broad), effective
communication (sharing, simple to understand)

Example: Visualizing a cholera outbreak that was traced to a
geographical water pump with clusters around pump location

### Part art, part science

Art: no right answer, subject aesthetics, different approaches to
display data Science: statistics, calculations

- Communicating complex ideas: be intentional and select visualizations
  that encourage insights, use communication (e.g. language, accessible
  methods) appropriate to audience

### Design: Gestalt Principle of Visual Perception

- Gestalt = shape/form in German
- Proximity (how close objects in a visual are to each other and their
  relationship)
  - Examples: Table borders, spacing
- Similarity
- Closure
- Symmetry
- Connection
- Continuity

### Declutter

Remove amount of space taken up on paper/screen:

- Consistent fonts, colours, formatting, add story text
- Remove gridlines
- Simple language
- Readable labels and directly label rather than using legends
- Use whitespace

### When to Use Which Charts

- Comparison: Column, Bar, Line, Slope, Dumbbell, Pie
- Composition of a whole: Stacked, Column/bar, Pie, Treemap
- Distribution: Histogram, Density Plot, Scatterplot, line
- Trends: Line, Column, Area
- Relationship: Scatterplot, Bubble

Note: Pie charts are *not recommended* as people find difficulty in
seeing differences in slices, especially with more than 4 slices. Angles
are harder for people to perceive, so consider other formats like text
tables.

### Accessibility

- Tell the truth about data: Visualization can be presented to change
  truth about data. For example editing axis, scales
- Visualizations must meet accessibility standards (distinguishable
  colours, font and sizes, alternative text, tables left to right and
  top to bottom, text box order, (tools) test for accessibility)

### Design Issues

Q: Related to "Understand Your Audience" - are there any practices you
have learned to keep in mind when visualizing data for both English and
French / multilingual audiences?

- Send for translation
- French text will take 1.25-1.5 times more space, sometimes design for
  French first to account for spacing
- Choose simple word selection in other language or provide explanations

Q: How to identify outliers?

Histogram, box plat, or density plot of normal distribution, edges will
show outliers.

Q: How to assess default visuals in programs?

Check the defaults meet the principles explained above
