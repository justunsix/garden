My personal notes, from Epilogue chapter

Practices to "stay young":

1.  Have a good long term relationship
2.  Friendships, be with others, community feeling
3.  Purpose in life, volunteer, meaningful job
4.  Empathy, care for others, nature, climate
5.  Kindness
6.  Genetics
7.  Diet
8.  Exercise
