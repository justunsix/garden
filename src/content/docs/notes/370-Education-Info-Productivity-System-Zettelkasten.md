## Zettelkasten System Use and Principles

Source: [Why Use Zettelkasten
system](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125)

1.  Atomicity - one note, one idea
2.  Autonomy - each note is self contained
3.  Always link notes to other notes (hyper text)
4.  Explain connection between notes when you are linking them
5.  Use your own words, avoid copy and paste
6.  Keep references - to remember where you got the ideas
7.  Add your own thoughts to the note
8.  Don't worry about structure, it will develop organically
9.  Create connection notes - notes that link other notes and explain
    their relationship
10. Add outline notes - as notes come to themes, create outline notes
    that contain links to other notes (e.g. Wikipedia categories). Order
    notes into a story, narrative, argument
11. Never delete old notes - instead link to new notes / explain why not
    reference old ones
12. Add notes without fear

slip notes) are:

Anatomy of a Zettel ("slip notes") / a note:

1.  A unique identifier
2.  A body
3.  References for source of knowledge

A note about note relationships is a structure note.

### Implementation

- Index notes (e.g. numbers, unique IDs/names). Use index to reference
  notes - my implementation is GitHub folder with unique markdown file
  names
- Tag notes then create a note with all the tags you've used and list of
  index notes that match the given tag - my implementation is nested
  tags extension and tagging
