### Search for patterns with :grep, :lgrep, :vimgrep, :lvimgrep

| Description                                   | Shortcut               |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Grep, with external application               | :grep                  |
| Grep, see results in quickfix list            | :cw or :copen          |
| Grep, with external application, local window | :lgrep                 |
| Grep, see results quickfix list, local window | :lw or :lopen          |
| Grep, on all files with pattern               | :grep my-pattern \*    |
| Grep, include hidden dotfiles                 | :grep my-pattern ./.\* |

Usage:

:vim\[grep\]\[!\] *{pattern}*\[g\]\[j\] {file} …

- 'g' option specifies that all matches for a search will be returned
  instead of just one per line
- 'j' option specifies that Vim will not jump to the first match
  automatically.

### Quickfix List

Supports with Vim's edit-compile-edit cycle to edit code, compile for
errors and fix them.

| Description     | Shortcut |
|-----------------|----------|
| Quickfix, Open  | :copen   |
| Quickfix, Close | :cclose  |
| Next item       | :cnext   |
| Previous item   | :cprev   |

For c, think of it as compilation

### :copy, :move, :norm examples

- Copy previous 2 lines and current line: `:-2,t`
- Move line down: `:m+1`, move line up 2 `:m-2`
- Append \\ to all lines in buffer: `:%norm A\\`
- In Python, comment all lines with the word print: `:g/print/norm I#`
- Find all lines with the pattern beg.\*tab (e.g. \begin{tabular}) and
  go to line before and append \\ to line: `g/beg.*tab/norm kA\\`
  - Find all the lines matching the pattern beg.\*tab (a way for me to
    match \begin{tabular} without having to type the whole thing).
  - For each of those lines, go to the preceding line.
  - Append \\ to that line.

2.  Using do commands to search and replace

    Source: [Search and replace in multiple files - Vim Tips
    Wiki](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Search_and_replace_in_multiple_buffers)

    - :argdo: (all files in argument list)
    - :bufdo (all buffers)
    - :tabdo (all tabs)
    - :windo (all windows in current tab)
    - :cdo (all files/items listed in quickfix list)

    Search and replace words in files in a directory using `:vimgrep` or
    `:grep oldpattern *`, then C-q to add all items to quickfix list,
    `:cdo s/oldpattern/new/g` on entries to make changes

    Vim command mode:

    ``` bash

    # Search and replace in all open buffers from :ls
    :bufdo %s/pattern/replace/ge | update

    # Explanation
    # bufdo     Apply the following commands to all buffers.
    # %s    Search and replace all lines in the buffer.
    # pattern   Search pattern.
    # replace   Replacement text.
    # g     Change all occurrences in each line (global).
    # e     No error if the pattern is not found.
    # |     Separator between commands.
    # update    Save (write file only if changes were made).

    # Suppose all *.cpp and *.h files in the current directory need to be changed (not subdirectories)
    # use the argument list (arglist):
    :arg *.cpp  All *.cpp files in current directory.
    :argadd *.h     And all *.h files.
    :arg    Optional: Display the current arglist.
    :argdo %s/pattern/replace/ge | update   Search and replace in all files in arglist.

    # Search and replace, change, with all files
    :arg **/*.cpp   All *.cpp files in and below current directory.
    :argadd **/*.h  And all *.h files.
    ...     As above, use :arg to list files, or :argdo to change.

    # Replace current word
    :arg **/*.cpp   All *.cpp files in and below current directory.
    :argadd **/*.h  And all *.h files.
    ...     As above, use :arg to list files, or :argdo to change.

    # Replace items in quickfix list
    :cdo s/variable_old_name/variable_new_name/g
    # Replace items in quickfix list with prompt
    :cdo s/variable_old_name/variable_new_name/gc

    ```

### Status, Spell Commands

    !ls

    # Get command output of {cmd} and place in buffer
    :r !{cmd}
    # Place date in buffer
    :r !date

    # Get file and place in buffer
    :r {file}

    # Replace current line with output of shell
    # Example use: decoding strings, formatting text like json, using . for the current line
    :.!{cmd}
    # Replace entire buffer with command output, using % for entire
    :%!{cmd}
    # Replace a selection with the output of a shell command
    # Example use: sorting, complex text changes
    :'<,'>!{cmd}
    #### Sort entire buffer
    :% !sort

    # Send current buffer as input to a command
    :w !{cmd}

    ## Practical Examples

    ### Backup a file
    :!cp % %.bak

    ### Insert External Data
    #### Date
    :r !date

    :.!base64 -d
    #### Format current line json
    :.!jq .

    #### Sort selection
    :'<,'>!sort

    #### Sort case insensitive
    :'<,'>!sort i

    ```

    1.  Key binding

        Execute current line and output the result to the command line.
        Execute in bash and see result in Vim

        Execute file and see results in Vim

and <https://www.brianstorti.com/vim-registers/>

- To record a macro and save it to a register, type the key q followed
  by a letter from a to z that represents the register to save the
  macro, followed by all commands you want to record, and then type the
  key q again to stop the recording.
- Example to store macro in register a, go down and delete line and then
  stop macro recording: `qajddq`

1.  Macros are just text and can be edited, examples

    - Add a semicolon to end of the `w` macro :let @W='i;'
      - W in uppercase means append value to the register
    - Edit the register :let @w '\<Ctrl-r w\> and change what you want
      and close the quotes
    - Copy `ivim is awesome` into the clipboard register "+ and execute
      @"+

2.  Sample Key Combinations

    Delete lines containing a string in a file

    :g/\<your<sub>string</sub>\>/d

    - :g Prepare to execute a command globally (on all lines that match
      a certain pattern).
    - /\<your<sub>string</sub>\> Start specifying the pattern to match
      \<your<sub>string</sub>\>. Replace this with the string you want
      to delete lines based on.
    - / End specifying the pattern to match.
    - d The command to execute on all lines that match the pattern. In
      this case, delete those lines.
