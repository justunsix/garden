title: Role of sodium-glucose linked co-transporter (SGLT2) in the role
  of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

education session with Ronald Goldenbury, Endocrinology

T2DM treatment + options, drugs, impact

## Care options

- No hypoglycemia
- A1C target
- Weight loss
- Insulin independence
- Blood pressure target
- Easy treatment in drugs
- Recommendations: lifestyle, weight loss, pharmacotherapy

Initial pharmacotherapy due to higher A1C \> metformin

Enhance insulin through:

- Drugs
- glucose loss = SGLT2 inhibition
- reduce glucose intake

Side effects: weight gain, tolerance, hypoglycemia, A1C impact

## About SGLT2 Inhibitors

- Consider metformin therapy
- Specific risks
- Renal function - an active kidney is required. Renal impairment will
  reduce use

Inhibitors block glucose reabsorption, resulting in glucose excreted in
urine. "You pee out glucose" and calorie reduction. Works best when A1C
is very high. High plasma glucose = more glucose loss.

Weight loss - good tolerance : )

## Good Effects

- Weight loss
- Lower blood glucose
- Lower blood pressure

## Adverse Effects

1.  Genital mycotic infections (due to glucose in urine)
2.  Urinary track infection (UTI)
3.  Osmotic related - increase urine output - frequency and volume
4.  Volume related
    1.  Increase water loss
    2.  Watch for patients who already are low on fluid
    3.  Caution on age, loop diuretics, poor renal efficiency (see
        patient eGFR Glomular filtration relate), ACE + ARB issues
5.  Hypoglycemia (rare)

## Other Considerations

LDL cholestrol, cardio, K+ concentration
