    - Use when passing, car doors open
    - Let people know you're coming
- ABC check
  - Air
    - Tires
    - In winter, there is more debris on roads, working tired more
  - Brakes and bars
    - Check back wheel up on front and skidding on back wheel
    - Lever should not touch handlebar on pull
  - Chain and crank
    - Lubrication and no rust, rust wears other components

      Riding](https://www.cycleto.ca/winter-riding-tips)
- Equipment
  - Tires and Fenders
    - Decrease tire pressure to lower end of range
    - Thick tires: feel more stable, but may get caked with snow
    - Thin tires: good for slicing through slush, and less treads may
      actually mean better grip
    - Studded winter tires: good for ice
    - Fenders: protect from slush but may fill up with snow
  - Other
    - Rags - for both the chain and the wheel rims
    - "Wet" lubricant
    - Lights and reflective tape (for both bike and clothing!)
    - Lighter (de-icer) for lock, always lock with keyhole facing down,
      cover lock
      - Lock in safe, clear area, no water
- Maintenance
  - Reducing rust on steel frames
    - Touch-up chipped paint and dents
    - Aerosol lubricant in drainage holes and posts
    - Clean and wax the frame
    - Wipe down bike after every ride and after cleaning
  - Storage
    - Avoid storing inside a warm building; changes in temperature can
      affect cables
    - Store in a garage, under a roof outdoors, or in a bike storage
      container if possible
    - If using a tarp, ensure ventilation
- Tips for winter riding
  - High visibility
  - Move out of snow drifts
  - When riding in clear conditions, become familiar with potholes,
    uneven ground, and obstacles
  - Practice riding on icy and snow-covered streets at a time/place with
    fewer cars around
  - Check the weather forecast, give more time to travel, more time to
    brake
  - Behaviour:
    - Use main streets
    - Light on front brake
    - Signal, shoulder checks
    - Cross streetcar tracks at 90 degrees and check location
- Route-planning
