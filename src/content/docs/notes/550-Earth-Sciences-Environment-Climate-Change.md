## How public servants can tackle climate change post-Covid-19

2021-09-08 Apolitcal webinar with Dr Debbie Rosen, Jazmin Burgess

### How the pandemic shone a light on climate change

- Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions?
  - Significant drops in March-April 2020
- Climate impact?
  - Research happened in real time, predicated and confirmed lowering of
    7% of emissions
  - Overall, no long term impact. Global lockdowns are not enough to
    stop climate change

### Need to look at green recovery for long term impact

- Raise priority of climate change
- Pandemic exposed inequalities
- People more in touch with environment because of lockdowns
- Support:
  - Job creation in green industry
  - Promote green start ups
  - Public interventions like green spaces

### Questions and Answers

How to address solutions? How to balance climate action and pandemic
action?

- Promote **climate mitigation and adaptation**
  - Example quick win on mitigations
    - Analyzing methane emissions which show few major emitters
    - Reduce aerosols
    - From pandemic: reduce emissions due to work from home, reduced
      travel, and better internet access
- Think of climate and pandemic as related issues, for example city
  inequalities and living space interventions
- Talk about **solutions separate from climate activism** such as:
  - Reducing air pollution, improving air quality
  - Youth employment in emerging sectors
- Digital and emissions?
  - First step is increase awareness of climate impact like crypto and
    data science

Global emissions trading?

- Politics makes trading problem difficult
- 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, Conference of the
  Parties (COP26) will gauge international commitment

How to ensure policy is climate change friendly?

- Use tools to check if policy could have a climate impact
- Interdisciplinary groups:
  - Example: Public health work links to climate change
- Gender and climate changes:
  - There are cities working on women and climate considerations.
    Example:
    - Barcelona - weather and women working and access to heat recovery
      services
