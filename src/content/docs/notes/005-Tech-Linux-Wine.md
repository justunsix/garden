title: Wine Is Not an Emulator (WINE)
---

"Wine (originally an acronym for "Wine Is Not an Emulator") is a
compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on several
POSIX-compliant operating systems, such as Linux, macOS, & BSD. Instead
of simulating internal Windows logic like a virtual machine or
emulator" - [WineHQ - Run Windows applications on Linux, BSD, Solaris
and macOS](https://www.winehq.org/)
