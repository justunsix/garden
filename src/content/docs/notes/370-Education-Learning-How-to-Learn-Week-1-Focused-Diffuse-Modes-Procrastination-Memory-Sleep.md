  Procrastination & Memory & Sleep

## Focused and Diffuse Modes

- Focused: Intense concentration, regular thought patterns
- Diffuse: open, new patterns can be formed, associated with rest states
  (sleep, shower)

## Using the Focused and Diffuse Modes–Or, a Little Dali will do You

- Focused - concentrations on a task, familiar previous thought
  patterns, tight thinking, detailed
- Diffuse - relaxed thinking, open thinking, big picture, new neural
  connections Can only use one thinking mode at a time

Analogies of thinking modes. Neurons linked are patterns

Salvadore Dali & Thomas Edison

- Both started with a diffuse mode entry (person was sitting, wandering,
  hold keys/ball bearings and letting them fall in diffuse mode while
  relaxing with mind free, then followed by a focused mode).

1.  Weightlifter analogy - Like sports and building strength, need to
    build neural structure over time, not all at once. "Bit by bit,
    every day".
2.  Learning something difficult takes time
3.  When learning, you need to use both modes.

## What is Learning?

About the brain, new synapses (connections) are created and recede all
the time. Creation happens over time and sleep. There are a million
billion synapses in the brain.

## A Procrastination Preview

What happens during procrastination

See something you don't want to do, activates pain like feelings in
brain

## Pomodoro technique

Do work in 25 minute segments with focus, followed by a rest & reward to
change focus, then back.

- 25 minutes - 5 minutes rest
  - Per [How to Take a Brain Break \| Jim Kwik -
    YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=30IpveNICwU):
    during rest try juggling or cross body movement for exercise and
    brain break
- No interruptions
- Focus
- Rewards

## Practice Makes Permanent

Difficulties in math & science? Difficulty in making analogies to
abstract concepts without a visual/physical reference.

The more difficult and abstract the ideas, the more you have to practice
to make the connections real in your brain. The neural connections are
real

## Introduction to Memory

Long term memory

Like storage warehouse, can be difficult to find info and need practice
in "retrieval" to get items effectively. Repeat retrieval and it becomes
accessible

Working memory (can come from long term)

1.  Usually works in chunks ~ 4 slots
2.  Like a blackboard
3.  Prefrontal cortex of brain

## Spaced repetition

Space out something you are trying to learn, e.g. over several days like
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, rest, Saturday, reset

## How to Integrate a Flashcard Retrieval Practice System into This Course

1.  Initial Learning
2.  Pick out key points, add as notes
3.  Add key points to spaced repetition flash cards and source material
4.  Use flash cards retrieval practice until you can retrieve easily

## The Importance of Sleep in Learning

Sleep is like unblocking a stream, allowing blood to flow in the brain
well and wash away toxins that have accumulated during the day.

If you want to dream about something, such as a learning, review it
before sleeping and think about wanting to dream about it!

## Interview with Dr. Terrence Sejnowski

Terry's research is in neural networks

How do you learn?

- Get involved, learn by doing. Experiment

How do you keep from getting bored?

- Ask questions from your perspective - use active engagement

Diffuse mode thinking?

- Exercise gets the mind on a different track, stimulates new ideas.

Multi-task or not?

- It cannot be avoided. Have uninterrupted time for yourself.
- Multi-task can be context switching instead of doing two tasks at the
  same time

Applied neuroscience to learning?

- Apply in the lab - we found enriched environments help with brain
  neuron development (new ones in the hippocampus). Exercise also do
  that.
- Being a creative environment enhances your own creativity.

Test taking?

Like any other skill, you can learn it. Let hard questions to go, answer
may come later.

How do you stay creative? And do well

- Surrounding yourself with different and young people. See things from
  another perspective
- Success = passion + persistence

## Optional Interview with "Benny the Irish Polyglot" about Learning Languages

- What are the wrong reasons to learn languages?
  - To show off or pass a course.
- Instead you should have a passion for that language. Talk to native
  speakers.
- Children's advantage in language?
  - They don't mind mistakes, play games. Be OK to make mistakes.

## Interview with Writing Coach Daphne Gray-Grant on Writer's Block

Daphne's site: <https://www.publicationcoach.com/> - She works as a
journalist and non-fiction writer

### Addressing Writer's Block

- Pretend they are 2 different people and only one can be driving
  - Focused mode = editing
    - Spelling, grammar
    - Edit after writing first, not at same time
  - Diffuse mode = writing
    - Mind mapping aka clustering
      - Most important parts will come up naturally using your memory
      - Memorization can help your understand something like poetry,
        literature
    - Write all ideas, no boundaries
    - An approach is turn off your monitor while typing, write without
      reading it, timing yourself
