## Writing Prompts

See "Improve Prompt Results" section of [Microsoft Azure AI
Fundamentals, Generative
AI](../006-3-tech-ai-artificial-intelligence-microsoft-azure-ai900-generative-ai) -
[Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals: Generative
AI](id:4e618b1d-6f89-4eb3-811b-be31133ea2f3) sourced from [Improve
prompt results - Training \| Microsoft
Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/fundamentals-generative-ai/6-writing-prompts)

Good prompts provide the AI with:

1.  Goal (what you want), see tasks below
2.  Context (people involved, why you need something), see job types
    below
3.  Information sources to use (attachments, documents, links, meetings)
4.  Expectation on what you want (tone, type of output, format, response
    length and details like sources)
5.  Iterate on the previous prompt

Other tips:

- Use positive instructions, tell model what to do instead of what not
  to do

## Learning

### Creating Anki Cards from Learning Document for a Student to Study

Create Anki cards in the Emacs anki-editor format by using the attached
document in markdown format about generative AI. Find key concepts in
the document and create at least 10 cards to cover important concepts in
the document. The cards need to help a student remember key concepts and
terms from the document. Provide the cards so they can be copied in a
code block. The Emacs anki-editor format for a card is:

``` org
* Card Heading
:PROPERTIES:
:ANKI_NOTE_TYPE: Basic
:ANKI_DECK: Artificial-Intelligence
:END:
** Front

Front of card content

** Back

Back card content

```
