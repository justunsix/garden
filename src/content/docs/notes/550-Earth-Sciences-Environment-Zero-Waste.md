## What is a Zero Waste Lifestyle

\[cite/t:@YourEcoFriend\] at Toronto Public Library

### 5 R's of Zero Waste

- *Refuse* what you don't need
- *Reduce* what you do need
- *Reuse* with reusable items
- *Recycle* what you cannot reduce or reuse
- *Rot* (compost) the rest

### Reusable Items (likely already in your home)

- Reusable bags: Using these instead of plastic reduces a significant
  amount of waste. Carry one in your purse, backpack, car, by your home
  entrance, work etc.
- Glass jar: Great for water, coffee, lunch, snacks, leftovers, compost
  etc.. Reuse rubber bands around the jar to hold hot drinks or an old
  socks as a cozy.
- Container: Got plastic? Use it! The black plastic takeout containers
  are not recyclable In Toronto. Reuse these until they fall apart.
- Cutlery & cloth napkin: Grab a fork and spoon from your kitchen or use
  single—use plastic ones and wash until they fall apart. Designate them
  for your zero waste kit. Wrap the cutlery up in a cloth napkin,
  bandana or tea towel. Napkins are very handy for grabbing a sandwich
  on the go, drying hands, protecting a jar, wiping face etc…

### If you need to purchase

- Second hand first: The item you need is likely already out there at a
  fraction
- Marketplace, swaps
  - If new, look for local, Canadian, ethically made goods made from
    glass, steel, wood. (i.e health food shops), or the following
    stores:
  - Logan and Finley
    [https://\|oganandfinley.com/](https://|oganandfinley.com/)
  - Karma Coop [http://www.karmacoop.org/](http://www.karmacoop.md/)
  - Bare Market <https://baremarket.ca/>
