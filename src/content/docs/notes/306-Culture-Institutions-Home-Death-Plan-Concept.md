## Wills and estates

Contact and retain lawyer for support and obtain will with lawyer or
local Ontario court and review will.

Probate court to determine if will is legal. Once determined legal, it
grants probate = approves a trustee to carry out the wishes of the

estate trustee (also called the "executor"), you are authorized to
administer the estate of the deceased person. You are considered the
deceased person's personal representative, and will carry out their
wishes as stated in the will.
