## Seedlings Care

A few quick tips for healthy seedlings:

- Keep “soil” in containers moist, but not over-watered. (Soil should be
  dark in colour but not soaking wet). Use spray bottle or add water to
  the bottom of the container – e.g., a plastic lid placed under the
  container. This way the water will slowly seep up into the soil. This
  is especially good for Fri. watering – the water will last through the
  weekend.
- Keep in mind, the smaller the container, the more frequent watering
  will be needed - the less soil, the faster it dries out. Wrap
  container in plastic to keep water from evaporating from the
  container.
- Once little shoots emerge, take lid off; keep containers very close to
  a source of light, such as fluorescent desk light – about 4 inches
  away from light is ideal. Otherwise, the plants will stretch
  themselves too thin – literally! – trying to reach the light.

****Prevention:****

****Sanitation:**** clean equipment and pots

****Growing medium:**** Use sterilized or heat-treated growing mediums.
Provide good drainage,

structure, aeration, and water-holding capacity.

****Seed Treatment:****. Some seeds come pre-treated with fungicide.

****Seeding Depth:**** Do not plant seeds too deep

****Plant Density:**** Try not too over crowd

****Fertilizer:**** Provide seedlings with the proper nutrients.

****Watering:**** Never over-water and always allow the seedling plugs
to dry out just a little between

watering.

### Steps for starting seeds indoors

1.  Plan your garden – determine what to plant and when.
2.  Clean your containers.
3.  Moisten your starting mix.
4.  Fill containers and tamp down lightly.
5.  Ensure that the containers will have adequate drainage so that
    seedlings are not sitting in water.
6.  Plant the seeds according to depth on seed packet.
7.  Water
8.  Cover if possible and put somewhere warm
9.  Once the seeds have germinated they will need light, so if your warm
    place for germinating did not have sun, move the seedlings to a
    sunny spot.
10. Ensure that your seedlings are kept moist, but do not over water.
    You may need to remove the cover or prop it up a bit once
    germination has occurred to ensure the seedlings don’t damp off.
11. Once the first true leaves appear, thin your seedlings by snipping
    the smaller ones off at the ground with a pair of scissors.
12. Once the first true leaves appear you may also need to provide some
    nutrients for the seedling.
13. Continue to water and nurture your seedlings – for tomatoes adding
    more soil will help make a stronger root system.
14. When it comes time to plant outside, harden your seedlings off by
    exposing them to outdoor conditions slowly.
