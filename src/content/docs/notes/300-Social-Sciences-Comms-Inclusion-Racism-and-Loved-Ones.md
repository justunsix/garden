## Loved One

### Discussion

Focus on the:

- Relationship
- Your impact and personal safety
- Responsiveness to approaches
- Accessible, relevant and appropriate
- Speak to their lived experience
  - Common history
  - People who were prejudice against them
  - Empathy
- Cognitive empathy, unlearn mainstream stories
- Challenge behaviour, share a fault of your own
- Forgive yourself - micro aggression haiku ~ creative side to forgive
  or allow your own feelings
- Seed planting (inception)
- If relevant, share data, statistics, resources
- Still love friends and family

### Action

- Set consequences for "non-compliance" e.g. avoidance, acknowledge
  difference, protect vulnerable
- Hope & reconciliation
- Remember your or others lived experience
- Self reflection - cognitive dissonance (inconsistent thoughts for
  behaviour, beliefs) and confirmation bias
- Positive reinforcement

### Intent vs. Real Impact

Person must demonstrate these to show impact:

- Acknowledge
- Emotional update
- Changed behaviour
- Accountability for actions
- Calm the hurt
- Invest in truth & reconciliation

Person does not use "false defences" like derail, minimization,
reduction,tokenism, hurt. Must focus on topic.

### Oppression and Racism

Levels: Internal, interpersonal, institutional

### Personal action

Bear witness to injustice - say it is wrong and/or ask harmed person how
they feel

Translate privilege to external awareness. Use power dynamics. "Right
person", "collect your people"

Self care, support, learning
