## 1 Location

- Planting methods are diverse:

  - Containers
    - Small plants: herbs, dwarf plants
    - Greens: kale, swiss chard
  - Raised beds
  - Rows

- Sunlight

  - Rule of thumb: 6 hours direct sunlight a day, check direction of sun
    - Hot locations like desert can do with less
    - Cool climates need more
    - Some vegetables and herbs can tolerate shade
  - Mark out the garden and check the sunlight at different times of day

- Start small, have fun? then make it bigger, too much work, make it
  smaller

- Other ideas: community, shared, or friends' gardens

## 2 Deciding What to Grow

- Choose your favourites but easy and good for the climate - check
  resources
  - Example easy to grow: green beans, tomatoes, peppers, zucchini,
    kale, swiss chard, cucumbers
- Always add herbs and flowers to support bees, butterflies for
  pollination and decoration
  - Herbs: parsley, thyme, oregano, rosemary, basil, chives, mint

## 3 When to do What

- Check planting time due to climate like sun and frost
- Check local spring frost date and cold tolerance for planting times -
  see online planting calendars

## 4 Soil Testing and Fertilizing

- Test soil to determine fertilizer use, also check for lead in older
  land
  - Choose fertilizer close to the nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium
    ration recommended by the soil test and/or use a fertilizer
    calculator
- If there is an issue, grow in shared garden or containers or plant
  flowers
- Check soil every 3-5 years, apply fertilizer before planting

## 5 Preparing the Space

- Drainage:
  - Gravel mixed with soil
- Raised bed and containers advantages
  - Clean soil, prevent weeds, good drainage
  - Build wood planks, metal braces, soil, mulch to cover beds, gravel
    (cover garden paths) and cardboard (cover existing ground)
  - Mulch conserves water, stops weeds, keeps soil cool, and keeps dirt
    off plants
    - Types of mulch vary from wheat, shredded leaves, bark, wood chips,
      and mixed

## 6 Getting Plans

- When getting plants, due to root growth the plant should be about the
  same size as the pot it is growing in
- Best to choose specialty garden stores, other options on big box
  stores, farmers markets, and online
- Avoid:
  - Diseased leaves
  - Insects
  - Weeds
  - Long stem growth
- Check which plants are better to transplant and which are better to
  grow as seeds

## 7 Planting

Planting:

- Spacing: Leave room between plants for when plant matures
- Proper depth
- Prune roots so they can grow out, especially if too many roots
  visible, don't leave them in the potted state
- Watering: water with light spray after planting to settle plant

Seed planting:

- Pull mulch off soil
- Small hole with depth per seed information
- Plant multiple ones in case some don't germinate
- Water
- Wait 1-2 weeks
- Remove extra leaves from extra germinated seeds
- Restore mulch around base of seedling

## 8 Maintaining and Troubleshooting

- Inspect for insects, check if good or bad, inspect leaves for damage
  - Image search or check pest of "name of plant"
- Watering:
  - Test soil with finger 1-2 inches deep
    - If dry - water
    - If damp
      - Water if not recently watered in last week
      - Water if in plant container
      - Do not water if plant not in container
    - If wet - do not water
- Weeding
  - Weeds should be growing in areas outside of planting rows and rest
    of garden area, pull those
  - Mulch back exposed areas
- Remove diseased or dying plants

## 9 Harvesting

Check schedules and look of plants

## 10 Celebration

- Eat vegetables or use flowers
- Freeze, pickle, or share extras with others
  - Freezing herbs and vegetables can last up to a year. Defrost
    overnight and use next day.
