- Shared by Maria Solana, McGill CS / math graduate from Colombia,
  formerly Microsoft Typescript

- Advocate for Rubber duck debugging, explaining/debugging code line by
  line through explaining in natural language to find difference between
  intent and actual code behaviour

- Side project: volunteer, minimal output is shared code

  - Journey of working on the project is most important
    - Advantage: you have complete control, prepares you for interviews
    - For example: learning version control, technology approaches
  - Learn, do presentation demonstrations and exercises
    - Technology learning:
      - Can use different libraries, frameworks, or languages to solve
        the same problem. For example instead of Typescript, use Rust.
      - Do an application in a different language/framework
      - Set up tools
      - Understand documentation of new function/API/tool
  - Ideas:
    - Extend the exercise beyond its original scope
      - Think small iterations
    - Choose an app, website, IDE that you like and use and feel is
      missing something and work on it
    - Potential is project can go further with users / start up

- Process on side projects

  - Iterating on the same website / features and refactoring and trying
    different things
    - Learning tools used
