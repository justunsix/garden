## Psychology and Parasympathetic for Stretching

Source: Correspondence with Amy Dryden and [Physiology of long
pranayamic breathing: neural respiratory elements may provide a
mechanism that explains how slow deep breathing shifts the autonomic
nervous system - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16624497/)

- How your breathing can affect what nervous system is triggered.
- Stretching a particularly tight/sore muscle you may notice your
  breathe may become short and shallow. This is common but what us
  happening is your sympathetic (fight-or-flight) nervous system is
  triggered and your body now has an even harder time relaxing.
- **You want your parasympathetic nervous engaged to** relax for
  stretching - digest system.
- **Focus plan: Practice conscious breathing** will help relax the mind
  and body during a stretch routine to allow for more effective muscle
  lengthening. When you notice your breathes are not even, slow down and
  re-focus.

## Tips from Relax Into Stretch

Source: My personal notes from book by Pavel Tsatsouline [Relax into
stretch : instant flexibility through mastering muscle tension :
Tsatsouline, Pavel : Internet

### Waiting out the Tension

Get in a comfortably stretched position and patiently stay in it for a
few minutes until your muscles relax.

- Increase the stretch. Your muscles will tighten up again. One more
  time, wait the tension out. Breathe deep and easy. Repeat until you
  are close to getting spasms.
- You may massage the stretched muscles and/or gently 'twitch' them once
  in a while to help the relaxation process and ease the discomfort.
- The technique of Waiting out the Tension works well only in select
  stretches that are comfortable enough to stay in for a long time.
- Never use the Waiting out the Tension for forward spine flexion or toe
  touching type stretches
- Don't get eager and start forcing the muscle into more stretch.
- Never stretch when you are in a hurry
- Don't apply the Waiting out the Tension technique to your back.

### Relaxation

Focus your intentions on the relaxation of your muscles and mind.

- Appropriate visualizations, for example heat, help relaxation.
- Anxiety and pain reduce flexibility. Reduce them by progressing at a
  comfortable pace and maximizing the safety of your stretches.
- Consider taking up meditation, the Jacobson's Progressive Relaxation
  Technique, or some other relaxation technique from sports psychology
  and Oriental self-improvement disciplines. The vibration and passive
  movement drills from Fast & Loose! are awesome.
- Control muscular tension in the face and hands because it reflects
  overall tension. Literally 'wipe' the tension off your face with your
  palms, slowly and firmly, from top to bottom.

### Contrast Breathing

Inhale maximally and tighten up your entire body, especially the muscles
you are about to stretch. Think of your body as a fist. Literally making
a fist will help.

- Pay attention not to decrease the amount of stretch when you are
  tightening up!
- Hold your breath—and tension—for a second or so, then suddenly let it
  all out with a sigh of relief. Let your jaw and shoulders go limp with
  the rest of your body. Let your fists and face play dead. Turn your
  whole body into 'a mentally relaxed fist'.
- The stretch will increase as the involved body parts drop down when
  the tension is released. Don't let them drop more than an inch or so
  at a time, to make your stretches safer.
- With the exception of the forward bending backstretches, you may stay
  in the relaxed position for awhile before the next contraction.
- Keep repeating the sequence until you can no longer increase your
  range of motion.
- Don't hyperventilate, or take in too much air. Compensate for deep
  breaths by breathing less frequently; hold the 'no-breath' for a
  couple of seconds following each exhalation.
- You can expand your understanding of the pneumo-muscular reflex and
  the effect of breathing on muscle tension by reading Power to the
  People!: Russian Strength Secrets for Every American.
- Hold your breath—and tension—for a second or so, then suddenly let it
  all out with a sigh of relief. Let your jaw and shoulders go limp with
  the rest of your body . Let your fists and face play dead. Turn your
  whole body into what Soviet psychologist Dr. Vladimir Levi called 'a
  mentally relaxed fist'.

### Isometrics

To develop strength-flexibility with isometrics, stretch as far as you
can, then flex the stretched muscle. Sounds just like isometric
stretching, doesn't it?

### Forced Relaxation

Stretch as far as comfortably possible and contract the muscles you are
about to stretch with one to two thirds of your maximum effort.

- Tension should increase gradually and reach its peak by the third or
  fourth second. Don't contract the stretched muscles explosively!
- Hold steady, unwavering tension. If you were holding a real weight
  with the target muscle, the weight would stay put rather than bob up
  and down.
- Don't hold your breath, breathe shallow.
- Hold the tension until it becomes unbearable, then release it with a
  sigh of relief— don't let the breath get 'caught' in your chest as is
  common for a very stressed out person; let go! —and immediately
  increase the stretch.
- Understand that 'immediately' means 'without delay' rather than 'with
  quick movement'!
- The duration of the contraction may vary from five seconds to five
  minutes. Find your sweet spot through trial and error. Start with
  thirty to sixty second contractions.
- If you have the mental fortitude, keep the tension until your muscles
  start quivering and finally collapse in exhaustion, unable to contract
  any longer .
- Use your head (duh!)

### Avoid Ligament Stretching

How can you tell if you are stretching a ligament?

If you feel discomfort or pain in the joint, you are probably doing it.
For example, your hamstrings meet their tendons a few inches above your
knees. If you feel a pull in the back of your knee during a hamstring
stretch, obviously you are loading the ligaments and joint capsules
rather than stretching your hammies.

The solution is to bend the knee slightly to unload the ligaments and
refocus the stretch on the area between your glutes and a hand's width
above your knees.

### Stretching Schedule

- 2 days / week isometrics, 2 sets per stretch
- 4 days / week relax into stretches
- Isometrics can substitute for warmup. Only do isometrics if you don't
  need coordination for sport later in the day.
- Sequencing:
  - Decompress spine before hip flexors stretching
  - Stretch groin after hip flexors

## Leg Stretch Types

### Kneeling lunge stretch

<figure>
<img src="..\media\Health-Stretching-image1.jpeg" />
<figcaption>A person in a yoga pose</figcaption>
</figure>

To learn a front split, start with the kneeling lunge stretch.
Performing this stretch often will greatly improve the flexibility in
your legs.

- Begin by kneeling on one leg.

- Make sure your front knee doesn't extend over the toe.

- Square your hips with your back knee flat on the floor.

- Hold your shoulders square, with your hands on the floor for balance.

- Gently stretch your body forward, feeling a nice stretch.

- Hold the stretch for 20 to 30 seconds, without bouncing.

### Reverse Lunge Stretch

<figure>
<img src="..\media\Health-Stretching-image2.jpeg" />
<figcaption>lunge stretch</figcaption>
</figure>

Reverse lunge stretch

Include the reverse lunge stretch in your daily stretch routine.

- From the kneeling lunge position, push your weight onto your back leg.

- With the front leg straight, lower your upper body onto your leg.

- Keep the front toe pointed, back leg flat on the floor.

- Use your hands for added support.

### Single Leg Stretch

<figure>
<img src="..\media\Health-Stretching-image3.jpeg" />
<figcaption>leg stretch</figcaption>
</figure>

Single leg stretch

The single leg stretch is another stretch used in split training.

- Lie on your back, raising one leg into the air.

- Grasp the lower portion of the elevated leg with both hands.

- Keeping your lower leg slightly bent, gently pull your leg toward your
  body.

- Use a towel or band to extend your arm reach

- Hold the stretch for 20 to 30 seconds.

### Assisted Single Leg Stretch

<figure>
<img src="..\media\Health-Stretching-image4.jpeg" />
<figcaption>held stretch</figcaption>
</figure>

Assisted stretch

Use a friend to make your single leg stretch even better.

- Lie on your back, raising one leg into the air.

- Have a partner grasp the lower portion of your elevated leg.

- Keeping your lower leg slightly bent, have your partner gently push
  your leg toward your body.

- Hold the stretch for 20 to 30 seconds.

### Straddle Split

<figure>
<img src="..\media\Health-Stretching-image5.jpeg" />
<figcaption>A person sitting on the floor</figcaption>
</figure>

### Straddle split

Straddle splits are executed by stretching both legs out to the side.
Straddle splits are commonly known as side, center or box splits.
Achieving a straddle split will make it easier to perform advanced dance
steps, including the popular straddle split leap.

### Straddle Side Stretch

<figure>
<img src="..\media\Health-Stretching-image6.jpeg" />
<figcaption>A person lying on the floor</figcaption>
</figure>

The best way to train for a straddle split is to stretch in a straddle
split position.

- Sit in a straddle position, extending legs as far as you are
  comfortable.

- Reach toward your right leg with your left arm, stretching your right
  arm toward your opposite leg.

- Hold the stretch for 20 to 30 seconds.

- Repeat to the left side.

### Straddle Center Stretch

<figure>
<img src="..\media\Health-Stretching-image7.jpeg" />
<figcaption>straddle stretch</figcaption>
</figure>

- Sit in a wide straddle position, legs extended as far as comfortable.

- Without bending the knees, reach to the center.

- Stretch as far as you can, maintaining a flat back.

- Try to lay your body on the floor, using your hands as support.

- Hold the stretch for 20 to 30 seconds.

### Oversplits

<figure>
<img src="..\media\Health-Stretching-image8.jpeg" />
<figcaption>A picture containing wall, person, posing</figcaption>
</figure>

Oversplits are splits in which one leg is flat on the ground and the
other leg is pulled higher. In oversplits, the angle between the legs
exceeds 180 degrees. Extreme flexibility is required for oversplits.

- Do not attempt oversplits until you are very comfortable in a full
  split position.

- Using cubes or some sort of sturdy support, place your body into a
  split position.

- Try to hold the stretch for a few seconds, being careful not to strain
  your muscles.

- Oversplits may also be performed by elevating only one leg at a time.

### Both Knees Bent Stretch

<figure>
<img src="..\media\Health-Stretching-image9.jpeg" />
<figcaption>Knee bent on mat</figcaption>
</figure>

- From a kneeling position, put one foot in front of you on a mat, step,
  or other object about a foot or more off the ground.

- Bend your leg to 90 degrees, and place your foot flat on the mat.

- Keeping your hips facing the mat, move your other leg backwards,
  bending your knee behind you, until you form a "mini split" from knee
  to knee.

- Push your hips forward as much as possible, working towards 180
  degrees from knee to knee.

- Keep your chest up and your hands on your front knee.

- Hold this stretch for 30-60 seconds at a time.

### Front Leg Straight Stretch

<figure>
<img src="..\media\Health-Stretching-image10.jpeg" />
<figcaption>A picture containing person, person, sport,
gymnastics</figcaption>
</figure>

- From a kneeling position, put one leg up straight in front of you onto
  the mat.

- Move your body back, so only your heel is on the mat.

- Your back leg should be at a 90 degree angle, and your hips should be
  "square" – they should be facing the mat, not turned one way or the
  other.

- Keeping your front leg straight, lean forward as far as possible.

- Hold this stretch for 30-60 seconds at a time.

### Both Legs Straight Stretch

<figure>
<img src="..\media\Health-Stretching-image11.jpeg" />
<figcaption>A picture containing person, person, sport,
female</figcaption>
</figure>

- From a standing position, put one leg on the mat in front of you.

- Keeping both legs straight and your hips square, lean forward as far
  as possible.

- Your back foot should be planted on the ground, with your foot
  straight or turned slightly out.

### Full Split

<figure>
<img src="..\media\Health-Stretching-image12.jpeg" />
<figcaption>A picture containing person, person, gymnastics</figcaption>
</figure>

Move to the floor and try a full split. In your split, be sure that:

- Your hips are square with your body. Your torso should be facing
  straight, not to the side, even if squaring your hips means you can't
  go down as far

- Both of your legs are straight, and turned slightly outward

- Your toes are pointed

- Your chest is up, not leaning forward

### Beginner Hint

If you aren't yet flexible enough to do a split with your hands
comfortably on the floor, try your split between two objects – mats,
springboards (as shown), or even books can give you something to put
your hands on. Then you'll be able to do the stretch without leaning
forward with your body.

### Square Out Your Split

<figure>
<img src="..\media\Health-Stretching-image13.jpeg" />
<figcaption>A picture containing gymnastics, person, person, sport
Description automatically generated</figcaption>
</figure>

To make sure your hips are square, try doing your split against a wall.
Your back knee should be almost touching the wall, and your back leg
should be bent at a 90 degree angle upward. Be sure that your back foot
is pointing straight to the ceiling.

You can also do this stretch with a friend holding your leg and helping
you to keep your foot pointing straight up.

### Oversplits

<figure>
<img src="..\media\Health-Stretching-image14.jpeg" />
<figcaption>A picture containing person, person, gymnastics, female
Description automatically generated</figcaption>
</figure>

If you can already do a square split on the floor, it's time to put your
foot up on a mat. This stretches your legs even further into an
oversplit – or a split more than 180 degrees.

For even more of a stretch, do your split between two mats or two
springboards.

Over split—take a pillow and place it in front of you. Go into your
split and put your front heel on the pillow. Hold this for as long as
you can. However, don't attempt this until you can do your split or are
very close to being able to.

### Ring Leap Stretch

<figure>
<img src="..\media\Health-Stretching-image15.jpeg" />
<figcaption>A collage of a person doing a handstand Description

</figure>

Another progression for women is to work towards a [ring
leap](http://gymnastics.about.com/od/majorcompetitions/ig/Amazing-Gymnastics-Photos/Xiao-Yiming-Photo.htm).
To do this, arch backwards and bring your back leg up towards your head.
A friend can help you with this by pulling on your arms and supporting
your leg to help you keep it in position.

Your foot should come towards your head in a straight line, not at an
angle (see photo).

### Bridge

Do bridge push ups from the head to increase flexibility and strength

## Back Walkover

Source: Gymnastics Stretching for back walkovers from Live Strong
(source no longer available)

To execute a back walkover, stand on your left foot with your right leg
off the floor. Your right leg should be straight and parallel to the
floor. Arch back, placing your hands on the floor as you use your core
muscles to pull you over, lifting your left leg off the ground. Move
through a handstand position with your legs widely split. In this
position, your hands should be directly under your shoulders. Gently
place your right foot on the floor and use your core muscles to lift
your hands off the floor and stand up. End your back walkover in a scale
position with your left leg elevated behind you. It should be straight
and parallel to the floor, while your torso remains upright.

### Shoulder Stretch

To hit the back bend portion of a back walkover, you need flexibility in
your shoulders. Stretch them in a doorway. Place your left hand as high
on the door frame as you can reach. Rest your right hand on your hip.
Keeping your left arm straight, take a few steps, and lean forward a
little to deepen the stretch to your shoulder. Hold the stretch for 30
seconds before switching to the other side. Repeat this stretch three
times on each side.

### Back Stretch

A back walkover requires a significant arching of your back. Stretch
your back and abdominal muscles for this arched position by lying face
down on the floor. Put your hands directly under your shoulders.
Straighten your arms, lifting your torso off the floor and arching your
back. Do not tip your head back or arch your neck at all. Press your hip
bones toward the floor, as you feel the stretch in your abdominal
muscles and your back. Hold the position for 30 seconds. Do the stretch
three times.

### Thigh Stretch

Tightness in the front of your thighs will make it difficult for you to
do a back walkover. Stretch these muscles by standing with one hand
resting lightly on a wall. Transfer your weight into your left leg and
lift your right foot off the floor. Grab the front of your right foot
with your right hand. Avoid grabbing your toes or ankle. Pull your right
foot into your rear end, making sure your knee is pointing straight at
the ground. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds. Switch to stretch your left
thigh. Repeat a total of three times on each leg.
