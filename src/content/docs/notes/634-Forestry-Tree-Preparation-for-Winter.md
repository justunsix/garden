Tips for tree care in winter or areas with cold seasons to protect them
from frost and wildlife.

1.  Plant native - plant tree native to the area as they are adapted to
    the local soil, climate, and wildlife and help with the areas
    natural development.
2.  Preventative pruning - Weak branches, especially on young trees can
    break due to wind and ice/snow. Pruning the tree during the dormant
    season of fall or late winter can reduce risk. A recommendation is
    to work with an arborist, particularly for mature trees.
3.  Water before freezing - Watering before the ground freezes reduces
    risk on winter drought and windy conditions that can dry out the
    tree. Look at appropriate amounts of water for the age of the tree
    and avoid over watering.
4.  Mulching for insulation and protection - Adding mulch like wood
    chips, leaves, and organic materials, helps insulate and protect
    tree roots from temperature changes over the winter. Mulch in the
    growing season will also help with weed prevention. Keep mulch about
    6 inches clear from the trunk to avoid rot. Optionally add compost
    below the mulch to give the tree a nutrient supply.
5.  Tree wraps, guards, barriers - Wraps and guards protect the tree
    from foraging animals, sunscald (too much sun exposure), and winds.
    Different wraps or guards may be needed depending on the local
    animal. Burlap barriers help evergreen trees survive better in
    winters and allow air circulation. Remove items in early spring to
    avoid moisture build up and rot.
6.  Winter care - During the winter, mark trees like with tall markers
    if they are near snow plow areas and avoid salt use near the trees.
    For slippery surfaces, using sand near trees is preferred. Brush off
    large snow build up to prevent damage to branches.
