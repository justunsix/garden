## Tips for Asking programming questions

- Explain your goal, what you a want to accomplish, not just the steps
  that led to your question

- Provide details on what you did

  - When did the problem happen like location of program error
  - If the error happened after a change, what was the change
  - If error happens consistently or at certain times

- Provide the full error message. If long, can use sites like [Discover
  gists Â· GitHub](https://gist.github.com/), [Pastebin.com - paste
  tool](https://pastebin.com/) to put the message as a URL and provide
  the URL with the question

- Explain troubleshooting you did so far to try to solve the problem

- List your environment like Python version, operating system and other
  relevant software/hardware

- Respect others as they are volunteering their time to help you
