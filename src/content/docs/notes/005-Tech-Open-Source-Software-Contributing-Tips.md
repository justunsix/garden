title: Contributing to Open Source Software Tips
---

Contribute to something you are passionate about and/or use regularly.

Choose things that compliment your skills like programming,
documentation, testing, and others.

## Contributing the first time

Start a issue/feature request or discussion for what you are thinking
about. If you have an implementation in mind, start with a draft pull
request to start discussion and get early feedback.

Look for issues tagged as easy or good for first time contributors.
