- Ensures everyone is treated equally
- Applies to all organizations, including employers, employees, unpaid
  and volunteer workers. Organizations have a duty to accommodate people
  to a point of undue hardship
- Since 1962, first human rights code in Canada

## Types of Discrimination

- Prohibits discrimination against people on a protected ground in a
  protected social area (i.e. employment, housing, services, contracts)
  - Discrimination = negative treatment or impact whether intentional or
    not, for example unfair treatment
- Goal is to fix the situation

Types:

- Overt or hidden / subtle
- Constructive adverse effect: Rules policies, procedures, requirements,
  eligibility criteria or qualifications may seem fair on the surface,
  but actually lead to discrimination. For example, the height and
  weight requirements for police officers have been deemed to be a form
  of constructive discrimination.
- Systemic: Patterns of behaviour, policies or practices that are part
  of an organization and its culture. Examples of this are the education
  and judicial systems.

Forms:

- Harassment
- Poisoned environment - ongoing and widespread discrimination
- Profiling - When a person or organization in authority subjects
  someone who is protected under the Code to greater scrutiny, lesser
  scrutiny, or other negative treatment for claimed or real reasons of
  safety, security or public protection. For example security officials
  in a mall following young black men more than other groups based on
  stereotypes.
- Discrimination by association
- Perceived discrimination

## Grounds of protection include

- Disability (In the Code, disabilities can include physical
  limitations, mental health, cognitive or intellectual development,

learning, hearing, or vision. They also can include epilepsy, substance
addictions, environmental sensitivities, and workplace injuries)

- Age

- Sex (like pregnancy, breastfeeding)

- Gender identity (2012)

- Gender expression (2012)

- Sexual orientation

- Marital status

- Family status

- Race & colour

- Ancestry

- Ethnic origin

- Place of origin

- Citizenship

- Creed

- Record of offences (in employment, if pardoned)

- Why is class not in code?

  - Hard to measure, though possible to set measures
  - May be challenging to check discrimination in comparison to the
    measurement

The Code states that everyone has the right to be free from
discrimination in five specific areas called "Social Areas":

- Services, goods and facilities
- Housing accommodation
- Contracts
- Employment
- Vocational associations

## Duty to Accommodate

Legal standard to accommodate people. Best accommodation is one suited
to the person.

There are three principles of accommodation:

- Design society inclusively
- Remove barriers
- Accommodate any remaining individual needs in a way that most respects
  dignity. Can be:
  - Rules
  - Policies
  - Procedures
  - Requirements

Organization must:

- Accept requests for accommodation in good faith.
- Act promptly.
- Ask only for information needed to provide the accommodation.
- Actively seek appropriate accommodation solutions and ask for expert
  help if needed.
- Cooperate with other parties where necessary.
- Respect the dignity and privacy of the person asking for
  accommodation, and make sure the accommodation process doesn't lead to
  reprlsals against that person.
- Cover the costs of accommodations.

### Example Accommodations or Accessibility Improvements

- Providing printed material in alternative formats such as electronic
  files, large print or Braille.
- Providing sign language interpreters or real-time captioning for
  people who are deaf or hard of hearing.
- Offering flexible work hours or break times.
- Modifying job duties, retraining, or offering alternative work.
- Installing automatic door openers and accessible washrooms.

### Exemption

Exemption is only granted in "undue hardship" where negative effects of
implementation outweigh the benefit of accommodation.

- An accommodation so expensive that it would put a company out of
  business.
- A severe health and safety danger that can't be reduced.

The accommodation provider must be able to provide evidence that the
undue hardship will result.

## Applications

- Social stereotypes about gender, prejudice and fear are often at root
  of discrimination and harassment
- An organization must have a reason for collecting personal information
- Trans people should have access to facilities for their work/play
- Flexible dress code
- Organizations should design and change rules to be inclusive
- Organizations are liable for discrimination
