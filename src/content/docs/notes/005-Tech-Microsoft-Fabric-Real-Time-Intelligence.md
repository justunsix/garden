## Use Case

Time sensitive information and analytic decision making situations such
as monitoring of deliveries and service providers where delays and
issues must be addressed in the order of minutes rather than hours. For
example, emergency first responder (police, ambulance, fire) unit status
and locations while on calls and at stations. Real time intelligence
enables ingestion, processing, storing, and querying of real time data
to support decision making and automate responses.
