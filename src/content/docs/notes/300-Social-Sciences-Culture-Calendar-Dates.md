## Adding Calendar Dates to Outlook using CSV

You can import the holiday dates into your Outlook calendar (individual
all-day events showing out of office) by downloading a file with dates
in a csv format. Example CSV files are given below for different years.

Following the instructions to import into Outlook:

- Open Microsoft Outlook
- Click File in the upper left corner of the application window
- Find the Open & Export menu, and select Import and Export menu
- Follow the steps of the Import wizard:
  - Import from another program or file (next)
  - Comma Separated Values (next)
  - Browse for wherever you saved the above file (next). Choose the
    option that best fits your needs, are you okay with duplicates?
  - Choose the calendar you want to add dates to. If you were already in
    your calendar, it will already be selected. (next)
  - You should not need to map any custom fields, click on the Finish
    button.
- If you want to customize the ‘Show Time As’ column, save it again as a
  .csv file using these numbers:
  - 1- Tentative
  - 2- Busy
  - 3- Free
  - 4- Out of Office
