Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/ai/strategy)

How to identify AI use cases:

- Automation opportunities: find repetitive tasks, data heavy
  operations, tasks with high error rates
- Ask users how they could be more satisfied
- Assess organization and industry with survey to find challenges and
  inefficiencies
- Set AI performance targets
