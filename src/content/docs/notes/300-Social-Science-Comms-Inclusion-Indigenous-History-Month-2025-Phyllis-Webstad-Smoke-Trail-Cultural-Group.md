My personal notes from a work event celebrating [Canada's National
Indigenous History Month
2025](https://www.rcaanc-cirnac.gc.ca/eng/1466616436543/1534874922512).

## Welcome

Acknowledgement of host [Native Canadian Centre of Toronto
(NCCT)](https://www.ncct.on.ca/). "Since 1962 the Native Canadian Centre
of Toronto has been a key meeting place for all people, of all nations,
from across Canada and all over the world. As Torontos oldest Indigenous
community organization and one of the original Friendship Centres in
Canada, the NCCT provides social, recreational, cultural and spiritual
services for the Indigenous community and visitors alike." - [About
NCCT](https://www.ncct.on.ca/about-us)

Welcomes by event organizers and leaders and land acknowledgement: we
are on the traditional territory of many nations including the
Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the
Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples and is now home to many diverse
First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples. We also acknowledges that
Toronto is covered by Treaty 13 signed with the Mississaugas of the
Credit, and the Williams Treaties signed with multiple Mississaugas and
Chippewa bands.

Session helps with TRC call to action 57 for public servants to continue
education on indigenous history, culture, and law and rights.
