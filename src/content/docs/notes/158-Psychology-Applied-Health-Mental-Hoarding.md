## About

- Items hoarded have little to no value unlike items gained by
  collectors. Also, unlike collectors or libraries, since items have no
  value to others, they are unlikely to be shared and hoarders are
  likely to be disorganized and clutter.

- Behaviour can risk negative health issues, interference with life
  (mental, emotional growth, relationships), and self-esteem and
  depression.

- Causes may be due to risk factors like:

  - Trauma
  - Previous (family) history
  - Related to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
  - Anxiety and coping
