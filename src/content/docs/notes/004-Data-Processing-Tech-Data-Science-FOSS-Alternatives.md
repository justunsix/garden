## Desktop Data Management

Problem solved: How to manage data on your desktop

Use cases for managing data:

- Entry
- Filtering and sorting
- Search data for fields, rows
- Analysis, query
- Viewing with easy data changes
- Storage
- Visualization

Software:

- NF: Excel
- FOSS: LibreOffice Calc
- Other open source - more different from Excel but similar or more
  powerful functionality:
  - RStudio (AGPL license)
  - VS Code
  - Emacs
  - Spyder (MIT license, some limits compared to RStudio)
  - Python, Jupyter Notebook, and other programming languages
  - Visidata

## Research on How to Replace Excel
