Source: [Conventional Commits - Specification for human and machine
readable commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.md/)

## Use Case of using Conventional Commits

Since commit messages are structured, they can be used for:

- Automatically creating CHANGELOGs.
- Automatically determining a semantic version changes based on the
  types of commits landed
- Communicating changes to others
- Triggering build and release processes
- Make it easier for people to contribute and understand changes so they
  can explore a structured commit history
