  Discipline
---

Source: My personal notes and content from [Cal Newport's Planning
System (In Detail) -
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FipKTzkTD4)

Explanation of how Cal plans work, work boundaries and alignment with
his values and vision. I noted the approach is similar to principles in
the book Stephen R. Covey's The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.

The benefits of the systems are:

- Can be applied by anyone for complex and ambitious goals
- Help people stay true to your values and be present
- Supports your life outside of work as you can trust the system to
  capture and track all work and set boundaries

## Core Documents - Describe your values and goals

For Cal they are:

- My values
- Career and personal strategic plans

The documents link to projects and weekly goals. Can be done in digital
and/or physical notebooks.

### Maintaining the Core Documents

- Review values once per week. Every week highlight values you want to
  focus on this week
- Review strategic plans once per week or quarter

## Productivity - Work plans

### Weekly Plan

Use a weekly plan that is flexible. It can be more flexible like in
summer months or vacation periods. It links back to the strategic plans.

### Daily Plan

Use a daily plan which uses the weekly plan and time blocks for work can
be done in the day. "What do I want to work on today?"

Have a work shutdown plan like time of day you stop work and start rest.

- Track tasks and events you did and still need to do
- Captures make you trust the system will keep track of things

## Discipline - Habits, activities, measures

Examples: how many deep work sessions, exercise time per week

Disciple sets boundaries and you can track the activities to measure
your progress.
