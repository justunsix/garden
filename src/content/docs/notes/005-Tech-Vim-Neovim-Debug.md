## How to Debug in Neovim

### Set up

Use the Neovim Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP)

Setup with nvim-dap-ui to user interface

An easy way to setup is to use [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.md/) DAP
Core extra and language extra for language you are using

### Usage

- Set breakpoints for place in code you want to start debugging
- Turn on user interface and set breakpoint(s)
- Run debugger with program and see:
  - Local variables, scopes
  - Set breakpoints, can step into a program running, going into code
    and libraries
  - Threads
  - Expressions - view details and make changes
    - Check values similar to a REPL and query

You can use expressions to check program information. Code can be edited
in real time.

Threads are useful for going through multi threaded programs.
