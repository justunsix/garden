## Yoga Inspired Practices and Growth of Neurons

- Online course, â€œYoga for Neurogenesis: Practices to Build Your Brain",
  taught by Mandy Lawson
- Neurogenesis - creation of new neurons in brain
  - Needed for cognitive functions like learning, memory, brain health
  - Neurons are born in the hippocampus part of brain. Stress can hinder
    neurogenesis.
  - Boosted through exercise and stimulating environments, reduces
    stress

Patanjali defined an eight-limbed yoga in Yoga Sutras 2.29 - quotations
from article with numbered pillars:

> \(1\) Yamas, encompasses moral and ethical considerations that dictate
> how you treat and engage with others. Key values in this category
> include non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, non-greediness, and
> the right use of your energy.
>
> \(2\) Niyamas refers to internal duties and principles such as
> cleanliness, contentment, discipline, self-reflection, and surrender.
>
> \(3\) Asanas, is the most widely practiced, focusing on postures and
> yoga exercises promoting physical health.
>
> \(4\) Pranayama involves various breathing techniques and breath
> control to enhance the flow of vital energy.
>
> \(5\) Pratyahara is the next pillar, which entails withdrawing the
> mind and senses from external stimuli to foster inner concentration.
>
> \(6\) Dharana involves the practice of complete focused concentration
> of the mind on a single point
>
> \(7\) Dhyana pertains to meditation, encouraging a state of calm and
> awareness.
>
> \(8\) Samadhi represents bliss, liberation, or enlightenment, the
> ultimate goal of the yoga journey.

### Approach to support neurogenesis - "LMNNOP" Model

- Using yoga-inspired habits from 8 pillars and putting them in daily
  routines

- Achieve through practice

- L - Love - can be romantic, loving interactions with family, friends,
  strangers, anyone

  - Improve connection with people, intimacy, share activity and
    kindness

- M - Movement - Slow hippocampus volume loss due to getting older

  - Research indicates moderate intensity exercise at least 3 times a
    week for 40 minutes slows loss hippocampal brain tissue and can
    increase its volume

- N - Nature - Hypothesis: neurogenesis, exercise and natural landscapes
  are linked. They can contribute to physical and mental health

- N - Novelty - environments rich in physical, social, and cognitive
  simulations

  - Creative engagement like new hobbies, games.

- O - Omega-3 - take care of your body and mind though food

  - Fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and role in brain
    development and health

- P - Pause - Many activities can stress nervous system

  - Cleaning one's thoughts, body, and environments
  - Meditations and mindfulness practice
