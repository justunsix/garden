title: Introduction to Data Science with Pandas
---

Source: [GitHub - stefmolin/pandas-workshop: An introductory workshop on
pandas with notebooks and exercises for following
along](https://github.com/stefmolin/pandas-workshop/tree/main),
[Slides](https://stefmolin.github.io/pandas-workshop/slides/html/workshop.slides.html#/intro)

## Introduction

- See resources for code and slides, follow slides through Jupyter
  notebooks to see and run code
- Prerequisite knowledge: Python, Jupyter notebooks

### Getting Started

- Introducing Series, DataFrame, and Index classes - basics of the
  pandas library to create DataFrames, do operations on them and
  inspect/filter data.

### DataFrame

- Composed of one or more Series and an Index

- Series = column names

- Index = row labels

- DataFrames can be created from sources like:

  - Python objects
  - Files
  - Webscraping
  - APIs
  - Other examples at [IO tools (text, CSV, HDF5 pandas 2.0.3
    documentation](https://pandas.pydata.md/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html)

### Inspect Data

- Check rows/columns, volume of data
