In 2025 \| Cal Newport - YouTube](https://youtu.be/gmoIIkm0gJc)

Goal is to make virtual work better, increase productivity, and make job
enjoyable.

### Better Remote Work

1.  Successful Remote / Virtual Work with Workload System and Structured
    Communication

    1.  Clear workload system

        - Know what you/your team are working on
        - Know when it's done
        - Load is manageable

    2.  Structured communication

        - Information flow is known
        - Unscheduled communications are minimal
        - Communications are asynchronous and predictable

    3.  Examples

        - Software development. People are assigned specific tasks in a
          shared board meeting workload system and communications can be
          done in board. Daily meetings at same time each day help with
          status reports and working on problems.
        - Claims processing. Queues of claims and their process are
          known and assigned.
        - Example of unsuccessful workplace. Work is assigned as needed
          and not tracked and done in ad hoc messages.

2.  Small Scale Seasonality

    Smaller scale means like in a day, week, there are variations in
    intensity in work.

    Looks for accountability rather than accessibility. People are
    accountable but you may not be available for all meetings, ad hoc
    communications. It allows scheduled times for work.

    1.  Examples

        - No meeting Mondays/Fridays
        - Balance light and hard days or breaks
        - Hybrid virtual and office schedule where you load meetings and
          more communications on office days
          - Helps reduce ad hoc messages

3.  Spaces Matter

    Having a physical work space reduces work distractions and improves
    focus. Commute is a time and space separation of work and life.

    1.  Examples

        - Work from near home, you are not working in your home and it
          is close by
        - Make a space at home for work, it is like equipment you need
          for work
        - Have a space for deep work and a space for administrative and
          communications work
        - Consider adventure work, where you go somewhere interesting to
          work
        - Simulated commute, like a walk

### Focus, Energy, and Attention Management

Manage your time, energy and focus with a goal and plan, then practice
to learn and persist knowledge.

- Energy - proper sleep, food, rest, exercise
- Attention - cut distractions
- Focus - practice time for deep work, time management, test for
  knowledge and recall

### Slow Productivity applied to Learning

Study like a job: Schedule regular time to work on problem sets,
homework and do recall of what you learned. Check large deliverables and
work backwards from their deadlines to finish them.

Make strategies to work on tests, homework, study and evaluate
strategies. Do example problems.

Focus on studies and avoid time consuming extra curricular activities.

See book "How to become a straight-A student" by Cal Newport

### Sabbatical Writing Project Approach

- Habit: 5 days a week writing
- Join community related to your writing
- Put scheduled things in middle of week to leave focus time on other
  days
- Adventure focus time - go to a new place to work that is fun and
  interesting

Cal's approach on writing books: For non-fiction book, write annotated
outline and sell to others to get advance. Then write each chapter
sequentially, go back to write introduction and make edits. For fiction
books, write first and market manuscript.

### Social Media more Restrictions for Children more like cigarettes or junk food

Current social and legal trends is towards restricting children by laws
(like cigarettes) instead of parent oversight (like junk food)

### Issue - People prefer predictability in their work and communications.

The reach of technology like phones and laptops and communications means
work can follow people and can extend work hours as other try to reach
them for work purposes. Extending work hours can lead to burnout and
constant stress. Workload is a problem if it cannot be measured and
there are high expectations or perceptions of keeping busy.

### Solutions to Workload

Have transparent task management that can be seen by other team members.
For example, a task board or project management software. Workload needs
to be balanced.

### Solutions to Inefficient Communication

Solutions avoid unnecessary communication since there is an
understanding.

Have regular meetings with your team and transfer pending items to the
agenda of the next meeting. The regular meeting replaces multiple
conversations and improves communication efficiency. For example,
professors conduct office hours for students. Set time for help.

For complex collaboration, use an agreed upon process.

Have a channel like a phone or ticketing system for work emergencies
where you can be reached. The channel cannot be abused, otherwise it
will not work.
