# Updating Java at 2022-02 Session with Oracle

Session in context of managing Java vulnerabilities

Value of Java - write once, run anywhere on Java Virtual Machine

- Developer writes code, generates bytecode for running
- Libraries
  - Standard JDK, part of runtimes
  - Third party
- Key libraries that change periodically:
  - Security
  - Networking
  - Collections
  - NIO (input, output)
  - Internationalization
  - Date and Time
  - JDBC

JDK/JVM can be updated separately from developer generated bytecode

- JDKs updated at separate times from application
- Example: updatable applications without need to update bytecode
  - Developer - establish secure connections
  - JDK:
    - JDK 1.4.2: Use SSL 3
    - JDK 6: Use TLS1.0
    - JDK17: Use TLS 1.3
    - JDK future: Use quantum encryption
- JDK long term releases
  - Get frequent updates, source open at OpenJDK
  - 8
  - 11
  - 17
  - Can keep in existing LTS releases and update it or upgrade to next
    LTS version
    - Update (e.g. 17.0.1 to 17.0.2) - low risk
      - Why? incremental performance improvements, support for OS, bug
        fixes, vulnerability fixes, cryptographic updates
      - When? recommend apply as soon as possible
      - Issues?
        - Cryptographic updates commonly cause issues, e.g. SHA-1
          disabled
    - Upgrade (e.g. 8 \> 11 \> 17 \> 18)
      - Why? performance, support
        - e.g. shorter start up times, better garbage collection
    - Issues
      - Check libraries
      - New warnings in code
      - Do full testing of your application

JDK has packaged usage tracker

- Java Management Service (JMS), monitoring agent on each instance -
  send data to central location - Oracle Cloud Observability service
  - Look at desktop/server/device Java usage
- Shows support dates, downloads, and scripted commands to downloads
- Devices can be organized into "fleets"
- Show runtimes, vendors

  Temurin LTS version due to long term support, releases, and permissive
  license.
