Source: notes from reading about mental health boundaries such as book
Unf\*ck Your Boundaries by Faith G. Harper

## Setting Boundaries in Personal and Work Life

Source: mainly my notes from a Telus Health educational session

- Consider your brain has limits:
  - 3: average number of hours per day of mental focus
    - Deep Word by Cal Newport
  - 150: number of relationships that brain can handle tracking
    - Social by Matthew Lieberming

### Questions to Ask Yourself

- What do you want to remove from your tasks?
  - Remove or delegate items to focus on others
- What barriers are you putting on yourself?
  - Role requirements (work, parent)
  - Demands from others
  - Your thoughts:
    - Assertiveness
    - Confidence
    - Compassion
    - Guilt
    - Perfectionism
    - Control
- What would you want to take on?

### Acting on Boundaries

- Assess your workload and abilities
- Check the list against your values, urgency, priority
- Set boundaries on yourself and with others

### Set limits

- Be honest, assertive
- Say no without other conditions, still be compassionate with people
  asking
- Let people react and be ok with it
- Set expectations
- Set physical, time boundaries around work and other life to separate
  them - can be healthier for mind

1.  Examples

    - Set do not disturb times
    - Do not check things like digital notifications until a certain
      scheduled time
    - Talk about workload with those involved

### Benefits on Boundaries

- Focus on your values
- Balance
- Avoid fatigue, burnout, stress
- Can empower others that may be depending on you too much

### Delegation

What are good to delegate tasks?

- Repetitive

- Require skills you don't have completely

- No specific due dates

- Others would like to do it or prepare them for future

- Approach: prepare with person, plan, discuss, check and appreciate the
  person

  - Be patient with delegate and accept some failure
