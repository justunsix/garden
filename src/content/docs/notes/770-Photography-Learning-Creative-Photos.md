## Photography and Graphic Design

### Photo Post Processing Techniques

- Use RAW when shooting
- [Straightening](http://graphicssoft.about.com/od/gimp/ss/rotatestraight.htm)
- [Vignetting](http://www.gimp.md/tutorials/ContrastMask/) - screen
  layer with radial reverse transparent to FG gradient.
- Contrast Mask (uniform shadows and light)
- Contrast and colours curves adjustment
- [GIMP For Photographers:
  Levels](http://inphotos.md/2008/02/11/gimp-for-photographers-levels/):
  The Levels tool (right click on your image, select Colors, then
  Levels) is used to adjust the levels of the colours in your image by
  manipulating a histogram representing the image. In simple terms, you
  can make broad changes to the Red, Green, Blue and overall "Value"
  parts of your image. The single most useful function of the Levels
  tool is the "Auto" button. Click that button and the histogram will be
  stretched out. Your image should look better. If the photo lacked
  contrast, it can suddenly become a lot "punchier"!. Related is [levels
  tool in Gimp docs](https://docs.gimp.md/en/gimp-tool-levels.html)
- Selective blurring for backgrounds and certain objects (especially for
  high noise)
- High pass filter for sketch effect or sharpening [from Gimp
  docs](https://www.gimp.md/tutorials/Sketch_Effect/)
- Defocusing non essential elements
- Cloning and retouching photo abnormalities
