Challenge: Constant pressure to learn new technologies and tools,
knowing which to use.

Use these tips as a process to learning

## Separate concepts and tools

Understand concepts first and processes, then how tools solve problems.

## Understand goals, challenges, processes, problems of concepts before tools

Examples of concepts:

- Source code management
- Package management
- Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment
  - Example: why it is used such as goal of automation and continuous
    improvement, then look at tools
- Container orchestration
- Cloud
- Infrastructure as Code
- Continuous Monitoring

## Determine what problems tool solves and use for real use case

Most tools solve 1-2 use cases, know how they do it, learn alternatives

- Use tool, apply in a real project, but simple use case
  - Use tutorials and manual for specific steps of use case and combine
    for your project
  - Example, docker - containerize a real application, publish, and run
    it
    - Expand use case with other use cases
  - Example, terraform - create a infrastructure for an application

## Be patient with Tool

Build a foundation of knowledge, don't rush, otherwise you can get
easily confused

## Do Continuous Learning

Know concepts to check new tools or tool features
