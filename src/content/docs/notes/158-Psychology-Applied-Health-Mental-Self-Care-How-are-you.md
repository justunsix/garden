title: Self Care and How are you doing
---

My personal notes from a self care training led by [Dr. Shahana
Alibhai](https://drshahana.com/) to increase awareness on mental health.
[Foundry - Where Wellness Takes Shape](https://foundrybc.ca/) that makes
health care accessible including same day counselling.

From the training, I added connections I believe to -
[Stoicism](../158-psychology-applied-health-mental-stoicism) -
[Stoicism](id:3615be88-f25a-4fba-98c4-42f34c59be5d) such as virtue.

## Feelings

Ask how you might ask someone how they are really feeling? with health,
work, finances, relationships, family, wins and losses

Vulnerability comes by being responsible for your mental health and ask
what you are going to do and take action. Managing your mental health is
ongoing and changing.

## What questions do you ask?

- What does one feel? It might be numbness (feeling nothing)
- Are you feeling happy in your life (feelings in life areas like
  relationships, work, health, etc.) and happy with your life (purpose,
  add value)?

## Stress, Emotion, Perception

When there are perceived problems with life areas like family and
finances, you can have stress. Stress can come from perceptions and
expectations.

## Personal Stories, like personal narrator

A story you tell yourself (you never, you should, you could be, you have
to) may be distracting and driving you away from your virtue.

Self care involves being aware of these stories and things you may be
doing to regulate feelings, like addictions and media consumption.

## Fear and Shame

Be aware of your fears like fear of judgement, not being good enough,
rejection.

Opposites of your values can be fears like:

- Connection and fear of being alone
- Prestige and fear of have low value

Address them and aware fears will return later. Practice will make it
easier to reduce impact of fears.

## Self Care

Self care for stress

- Know not everything will go your way - address expectations. Value
  virtue, what you believe is important
- Be aware of your emotions and perceptions, name them and it helps move
  through the emotions.

Self care for personal stories involves physical activity, meditation.

Examples:

- Breath where exhale greater than inhale - a physiological sigh which
  relaxes body.
- Short exercise activity, less than 5 minutes. Like a couple reps or
  (self) hug
- Mental time travel - review an issue a week or more later instead of
  right now
- Ask what might your mental/hero do?
