Goal is to make virtual work better, increase productivity, and make job
enjoyable.

## Better Remote Work

### Successful Remote / Virtual Work with Workload System and Structured Communication

1.  Clear workload system

    - Know what you/your team are working on
    - Know when it's done
    - Load is manageable

2.  Structured communication

    - Information flow is known
    - Unscheduled communications are minimal
    - Communications are asynchronous and predictable

3.  Examples

    - Software development. People are assigned specific tasks in a
      shared board meeting workload system and communications can be
      done in board. Daily meetings at same time each day help with
      status reports and working on problems.
    - Claims processing. Queues of claims and their process are known
      and assigned.
    - Example of unsuccessful workplace. Work is assigned as needed and
      not tracked and done in ad hoc messages.

### Small Scale Seasonality

Smaller scale means like in a day, week, there are variations in
intensity in work.

Looks for accountability rather than accessibility. People are
accountable but you may not be available for all meetings, ad hoc
communications. It allows scheduled times for work.

1.  Examples

    - No meeting Mondays/Fridays
    - Balance light and hard days or breaks
    - Hybrid virtual and office schedule where you load meetings and
      more communications on office days
      - Helps reduce ad hoc messages

### Spaces Matter

Having a physical work space reduces work distractions and improves
focus. Commute is a time and space separation of work and life.

1.  Examples

    - Work from near home, you are not working in your home and it is
      close by
    - Make a space at home for work, it is like equipment you need for
      work
    - Have a space for deep work and a space for administrative and
      communications work
    - Consider adventure work, where you go somewhere interesting to
      work
    - Simulated commute, like a walk

## Focus, Energy, and Attention Management

Manage your time, energy and focus with a goal and plan, then practice
to learn and persist knowledge.

- Energy - proper sleep, food, rest, exercise

- Attention - cut distractions

- Focus - practice time for deep work, time management, test for
  knowledge
