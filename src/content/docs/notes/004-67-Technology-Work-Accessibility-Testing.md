## Methodology

Three step approach to testing for accessibility: (a) automated; (b)
manual; and using (c) assistive technology. This approach makes sure
accessibility issues are found and with a balance of testing. To break
it down for you, the following tools are used at the ACOE for the three
step testing approach:

**Automated**

Tools include:

- WAVE, axe DevTools, and other browser extensions, browser console,
  bookmarklets (see [Using Bookmarklets for Accessibility
  Testing](../004-67-technology-work-accessibility-testing-web-bookmarklets) -

- [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/) for Web
  and applications
- Colour Contrast Analyser (CCA)
- Compliance Sheriff

**Manual**:

Use a manual testing checklist, like based on [Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.md/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)

**Assistive Technology**:

[NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.md/about-nvda/), accessibility features in
operating systems
