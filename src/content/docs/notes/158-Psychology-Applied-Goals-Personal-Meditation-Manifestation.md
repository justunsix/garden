## Envision Your Best Possible Self

Source: [Workplace Strategies for Mental
Health](https://www.workplacestrategiesformentalhealth.com/)

How to take this break

- Select a time period (3 months, 1 year, 5 years). Visualize your best
  possible self at this point in time, in a way that is pleasing and
  interesting to you. Imagine the details. Think about reaching your
  full potential, an important milestone, or realizing a future life
  dream. Reach high, yet be realistic.
- After you have a fairly clear image, write about the details. Writing
  it down helps create a logical structure for your future and can help
  you move from fuzziness to concrete, real possibilities.
- What character strengths do you observe in this image of yourself?
  What strengths will you need to use to make your vision a reality?
- Write down your specific goals and action plan that result from your
  Best Possible Self writings.

Why this counts

This activity boosts positive emotions, happiness, optimism, hope,
coping skills, positive expectations about the future. Looking into the
future is an important pathway to setting goals that are personally
meaningful.

### About

- Inspired by 2024-10 OPS meditation session, meditating on my desired
  reality, saying it out loud and focusing on it

### Manifestation Morning Routine

- Wake up, ask yourself: what would the highest version of me choose to
  think, feel, and do?
  - Think habits
  - Remove distractions
- Match thoughts to desired reality - your desire will become natural
  product of your being
- Highest version of yourself = person that has everything you desire

1.  Journaling

    - Reflect on your patterns, what you want and become

    Questions to ask yourself to help with journaling:

    - What am I manifesting into my life right now?
    - What would the highest version of myself do every morning? What is
      their routine?
    - What habits would I stop doing? What makes me feel negative? What
      makes me feel positive?
    - How would the highest version of myself think, feel & act?
    - How can \| embody these thoughts, feelings, actions & habits now?
    - Is there anything holding me back?
    - If so, how would the highest version of myself handle this
      situation?
    - How did this week go? What went well? What do I want to change?
    - How can I embody my highest self throughout the upcoming week?

2.  Meditation

    - Meditate and visualize yourself in that desired reality until you
      are that to go through your day

3.  Self Care

    - Food
    - Body care, self looks
