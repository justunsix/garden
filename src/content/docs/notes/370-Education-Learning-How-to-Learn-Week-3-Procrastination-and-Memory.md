## Procrastination

### Introduction to Procrastination and Memory

- Procrastination and memory is related to each other. Memory takes time
  to build.

- Pomodoro helps with procrastination

- Access long term memory systems

- Metaphor: Procrastination is like a zombie. Zombie is like a relaxed
  state your mind enters when doing common, habitual tasks.

### Tackling Procrastination - It is Easier, and More Valuable, Than You Think

- Metaphor - understanding poisons helps to cure them
  - Battle procrastination zombies which can hurt long term learning
  - Example: Take small doses of arsenic is not poisonous and allows
    build up of tolerance, but repeated small doses will have bad long
    term effects
- Procrastination is similar to addiction = irrational thoughts that
  will be unhealthy

### Zombies Everywhere - Understanding Habit of Procrastination

- Chunking is related to habits
- Habits save energy, mind can go with regularly used chunks, frees up
  mind to work on other things
  - Cue - Launch you to automatic mode
  - Routine - Habitual response
    - Like zombie, can be good, bad, neutral
  - Reward - reinforces habit
  - Belief - you must believe in the habit's effects

### Surf is Up: Process Versus Product

- Using mental tools and tricks to motivate
- "Quit wasting time, once you get going, you'll feel good"
- Focus on process (example: do 20 minutes), not product (outcome)
  - Process = habits, give your best effort on focused time
    - Zombie likes process
    - Create a space to focus
  - Product can trigger the pain causing procrastination
  - Use pomodoro technique
- Surfing the wave and go with the flow of the process

### Harnessing Your Zombies to Help You - Using Habits

- Cue - Change your reaction to a cue
  - Analyze what about the cue causes procrastination
    - Location
    - Time
    - How you feel
    - Reactions
- Routine - Plan a new ritual
  - Example: Leave phone behind, start in a comfortable seat at library
- Reward - determine reward based on achievement
  - Example: pleasure sure, gift for large reward, lunch with friend at
    12pm
  - Mind re-wiring can take time
- Belief - believe you can do it

### Juggling Life and Learning

- Recommendations:
  - weekly list of key tasks
  - daily todo list
    - a zombie without a list is listless
    - a happy zombie has a task list
    - can be mix of small product tasks and process tasks
  - plan quitting time, but be flexible
    - a good standard is 9-5pm, this time can work for students in
      university programs and workers in jobs
    - get leisure time, you will learn better
  - write journal of tasks

- Use pomodoro as process to work on tasks
- In morning, do tougher tasks first: Eat your frogs first

- Remember: Law of Serendipity: Lady Luck favours those who try

### Summing Up Procrastination

- Learning involves regular practice, like exercise

- Keep a planner journal

- Commit to processes and tasks each day

- Give rewards for finished tasks

- Watch for procrastination cues

- Trust in the process and system

- Work on tough tasks first: "Eat your frogs first"

## Memory

### Diving Deeper into Memory

- Your mind is built to store visual memories - example visiting a new
  place and you can remember its layout, location, and where things are

<figure>
<img
src="../media/Learning-How-to-Learn-Week3-2024-12-26-fequalma.png" />
<figcaption>Example, Newton's Law image to remember formula</figcaption>
</figure>

- f = flying, m = mule, a = stands for something up to you like air
  - Can also think smell of mule, wind sounds of air
- An image connects with right side of brain
  - Images is like neural hook to recall information
    - Image can give smell, sounds
  - Use spaced repetition like index cards to help with memory
  - Images are memorable
- Spaced repetition index cards - can draw image, write and say answers
  to build auditory memory

## What is Long Term Memory?

- Memory research: A patient HM had an operation for epilepsy that took
  out his hippocampus that removed their ability to make new memories
- New memories are formed using reconsolidation
  - False memories can be created with visualization

<figure>
<img
src="../media/Learning-How-to-Learn-Week3-2024-12-26-Memory-Consolidation.png" />
<figcaption>Memory consolidation and reconsolidation</figcaption>
</figure>

- Short term memory goes through consolidation to long term memory
- Sleep helps build memories
- Applying to learning, it is better for memory to learn in short
  sessions over many months rather than studying all at once

### Inside the Brain

- In additional to neurons, brains have several types of supporting
  cells called glial cells:
  - The astrocyte is the most common glial cell in human brain. They are
    involved in learning.
  - Astrocytes provide nutrients to neurons, maintain extra cellular ion
    balance, and are involved with repair following injury

### Creating Meaningful Groups and the Memory Palace Technique

- Create meaningful groups of words:
  - Example: remember plants to ward vampires
    - Garlic, rose, hawthorn, mustard = GRHM with first letters, imagine
      a Graham cracker
- Associate things to personal things/ideas, memorable phrases
  - Example 11.0 - good time for a 100 meter race, Dr Mrs Vandertramp
  - See if others have come up with memory tricks or make your own
  - Sentences with first letter of words to remember list of items

1.  Memory Palace

    - Think of a place you know
    - Associate parts of the place with memories you want to store
    - Example: grocery list pictured in your home
      - Bread on your couch
      - Milk on your coffee table
      - Egg on the floor

    <figure>
    <img
    src="../media/Learning-How-to-Learn-Week3-2024-12-26-Grocery-List-Memory-Palace.png" />
    <figcaption>Grocery list in your memory palace at home</figcaption>
    </figure>

    - First use of memory palace can take time

    - Palace expands working memory to access long term memory

    - Makes you creative, make connections early in learning, chunks

    - Research support

      - One study showed that a person using the memory palace technique
        could remember more than 95 percent of a 40 to 50 item list
        after only one or two practice mental walks where the items were
        placed on the grounds or the local university
      - People use memory tricks outperform those who don't
      - Memory tricks speed up learning and creating chunks and big
        picture templates

### Summing Up Memory

- Long term memory - build with repetition on retrieval over time
- Working memory - holds 4 items, each item could connect to complex
  long term memories
- Use visual systems to remember, use senses - funny, creative images
  will help
  - Like memory palace
- Memorizing material helps you master what you are learning

## Interviews

### Interview with 4 Time US Memory Champion Nelson Dellis

- Mental athlete with a diverse background and hobbies
- Example of recalling numbers in sequences
  - Use a picture for every number
- Practice?
  - Competitive: hours / day
  - Every day people: less time / day

1.  Memory techniques

    - Visualization:
      - Create a mental picture, attach picture to a memory palace
    - How to remember people you meet?
      - Use a distinguishing feature of them to place them - their
        location
      - Get their name - associate with something, can be anything
      - Imagine name with the feature
    - How to remember multiple people quickly?
      - It is hard
      - Ask them their name if needed, get to know them
      - Record their feature and name again
    - How to remember people after a long time?
      - Get to know them, listen and pay attention
      - Some people are better than others
      - Space repetition, like index / business cards - like a game
    - How might students memorize concepts, terms, complex systems,
      theory?
      - In competitions, memory athletes trained on specific items to
        memorize them
      - Memory exercises help with memory in general, use basics
        - Visualization / picture - can be unrelated to the theory,
          store it in memory palace
        - Hard part is creating the picture
    - How to memorize long text?
      - Easier to remember concept
      - Word for word memory
      - Find list of key words, memorize list of words - pictures and
        then memory palace
    - Who to keep memory into old age?
      - Concentrate on brain health
        - Memorize regularly
        - Try challenging items
        - Physical activity
        - Be social
        - Eat healthy
          - Ensure nutrients
      - Remember to play, use imagination, inner child

### Interview with Dr. Robert Gamache, an Award-winning Bilingual Scientist

- Professor, researcher

- How does being bilingual French/English help with your work?

  - Studying another language helped my natural language
  - It is good to study a little bit of each course subject each day
    - Usage promotes learning, it is in your mind

- You stumbled in learning techniques while learning, what are they?

  - Now backed with research, for example spaced repetition and practice
    helps with learning
  - Techniques works for science and humanities - works with learning in
    all areas
  - While taking breaks, found answers to problems and concepts
    - If you get stuck, it is good to take a break, do a rhythmic
      exercise or sleep on it

- Balance family and work life?

  - Scientists is like a professional athlete, need to constantly
    practice and produce
  - Even during relaxation, your mind is always working. Because of
    breaks, you remain productive.

- How does your dog Newton help your students?

  - Lighten up the learning
  - Create pictures of the dog doing physics
  - Show students examples of how physics or any subject can be useful,
    something visible and tangible

### Keith Devlin from Stanford, the NPR "Math Guy"

- Influential on Math learning

- What is a tip for approaching math problems?

  - Don't panic - Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
  - Understand what:
    - Achieve
    - What you have
  - Try different numbers, diagrams, approaches, or drawings
  - If failing, take a break, then come back to the problem.
    - You need to try something different to make progress

- Tips for math solutions?

  - Allow time for problem solving, don't think about timed tests and
    speed
  - Math is a difficult problem. Compare them to life/physical/family
    problems and apply a similar mind to math problems. Visualize the
    math problem like a life problem.

- How does exercise help?

  - Mind is focused on the physical activity, then work on a problem,
    then activity
  - Thinking, doing, thinking, doing pattern

- How to beat procrastination?

  - Avoid multi-tasking. Between tasks, I do procrastinate
  - Do serial tasking, focused time on task. Then move to next task
    until needing a break
