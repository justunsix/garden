Burnout is a type of [psychological
stress](https://en.wikipedia.md/wiki/Stress_(psychological)).
Occupational burnout or job burnout is characterized by
[exhaustion](https://en.wikipedia.md/wiki/Exhaustion), lack
of [enthusiasm](https://en.wikipedia.md/wiki/Enthusiasm) and [motivation](https://en.wikipedia.md/wiki/Motivation),
feelings of ineffectiveness, and also may have the dimension
of [frustration](https://en.wikipedia.md/wiki/Frustration) or [cynicism](https://en.wikipedia.md/wiki/Cynicism),
and as a result
reduced [efficacy](https://en.wikipedia.md/wiki/Efficacy) within the
workplace.

## Different Techniques to Try

Source: Marta S from work in 2016-10

### Emotional Regulation

1.  [STOPP](http://get.gg/docs/STOPP4.pdf) - take it slow, give yourself
    time to process it, think about other perspectives, select the
    "best" option

2.  [Defusing
    Exercises](http://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/docs/Defusing%20Exercises.pdf) -
    meditate on situation (other's and your thoughts). Use metaphors to
    observe and process or not process

Use metaphors try to see things differently. For example:

**Passengers on the Bus**

- You can be in the driving seat, whilst all the passengers (thoughts)
  are being critical or shouting directions. You can allow them to
  shout, whilst focusing on the road ahead.

**Playground Bully** (our thoughts can be our own internal bully)

- Victim 1 – believes the bully, distressed, reacts automatically (bully
  carries on)
- Victim 2 – challenges the bully (bully eventually gives up)
- Victim 3 – acknowledges then ignores the bully, changing focus of
  attention.

**The River**

- Items floating down the river – perhaps leaves or bits of mucky debris
  (thoughts, feelings,
- images) – instead of struggling to float, we can stand on the bank
  watching it all go by

**The Beach Ball**

- We try to stop thoughts – we hold the ball under water, but it keeps
  popping up (thoughts). We can allow the ball to float around us, just
  letting it be.

**Thought train**

- We can sit on the train, watching the scenery (thoughts, images,
  sensations) go by, or stand on the platform watching the thought train
  pass by – we don't have to jump on it.

**The Tunnel**

- When we get anxious driving through a tunnel, the best option is to
  keep going
- rather than try to escape. This feeling will pass – there is an end to
  this tunnel.

**The Mountain**

- Whatever the weather, or whatever happens on the surface of the
  mountain – the

- mountain stands firm, strong, grounded, permanent. We can be like that
  mountain,

- observing thoughts, feelings, sensations, knowing inner stillness

- Self Soothing (from [DBT Self Help \| Self-serve resources for the DBT
  community](https://dbtselfhelp.com/)) has to do with comforting,
  nurturing and being kind to yourself. One way to think of this is to
  think of ways of soothing each of your five senses: Vision, Hearing,
  Smell, Taste, Touch

  - VISION: Walk in a pretty part of town. Look at the nature around
    you. Go to a museum with beautiful art. Buy a flower and put it
    where you can see it. Sit in a garden. Watch the snowflakes decorate
    the trees during a snowfall. Light a candle and watch the flame.
    Look at a book with beautiful scenery or beautiful art. Watch a
    travel movie or video.
  - HEARING: Listen to beautiful or soothing music, or to tapes of the
    ocean or other sounds of nature. Listen to a baby gurgling or a
    small animal. Sit by a waterfall. Listen to someone chopping wood.
    When you are listening, be mindful, letting the sounds come and go.
  - SMELL: Smell breakfast being cooked at home or in a restaurant.
    Notice all the different smells around you. Walk in a garden or in
    the woods, maybe just after a rain, and breathe in the smells of
    nature. Light a scented candle or incense. Bake some bread or a
    cake, and take in all the smells.
  - TASTE: Have a special treat, and eat it slowly, savoring each bite.
    Cook a favorite meal. Drink a soothing drink like herbal tea or hot
    chocolate. Let the taste run over your tongue and slowly down your
    throat. Go to a potluck, and eat a little bit of each dish,
    mindfully tasting each new thing.
  - TOUCH: Take a bubble bath. Pet your dog or cat or cuddle a baby. Put
    on a silk shirt shirt or blouse, and feel its softness and
    smoothness. Sink into a really comfortable bed. Float or swim in a
    pool, and feel the water caress your body.

- [Distress Tolerance \| Get.gg -
  Getselfhelp.co.uk](https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/distresstolerance.htm)

  1.  **Radical acceptance** - experience situation as it is, no thought
      as to what it "should be".
  2.  **Turn your mind** - change mind focus back to the now.

### IMPROVE the moment

\*I\*  [\* Imagery\*](https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/imagery.htm) –
e.g. safe place visualisation

\*M\*  find [**Meaning**](https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/meaning.htm) in
the situation

\*P\*  Prayer –
[**meditation**](https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/meditation.htm),
spirituality, affirmations

\*R\*   [**Relaxation**](https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/relax.htm)

\*O\*  One thing at a time

\*V\*  Vacation – take some time out of the situation, 'me' time, or
[**imagining**](https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/imagery.htm) yourself on
an idyllic beautiful holiday

\*E\*   Encouragement – [**positive and calming self
talk**](https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/positive.htm)

**[Wise Mind](https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/wisemind.htm) ACCEPTS**

\*A\*       [**Activities**](https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/ace.htm) (see
distraction ideas below)

\*C\*       Contributing – helping others

\*C\*       Comparisons – comparing self with (better) self

\*E\*       Emotions – generate different emotions by watching movie/tv,
listening to music etc

\*P\*       Pushing away – thinking about or putting our attention onto
something else

\*T\*        [**Thoughts**](https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/thoughts.htm) -
new thoughts. E.g. counting, playing 10 (10 colours in room, 10 fruits,
10 Bond films etc), or 54321 (5 things I can see, 4 things I can hear, 3
things I can touch, 2 things I can smell or like the smell of, 1 slow
deep breath)

\*S\*        [**Sensations**](https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/links3.htm)
– use seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and touching senses

[**DISTRACTION**](https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/distract.htm) IDEAS

Distraction helps us feel better by diverting our attention away from
the distressing thoughts. It works even better if you choose something
that will really grab your attention and keep you absorbed in that
activity.

### Anxiety

1.  [Anxiety Self help
    strategies](http://www.anxietybc.com/adults/general-self-help-strategies)

        adaption, a problem when there is no danger
    2.  Learning to relax
        1.  Breathing
        2.  Muscle relaxation
    3.  Challenging anxious or worrisome thoughts
        1.  CBT - evidence based and balanced thinking
    4.  Facing fears
        1.  Expose yourself progressively
    5.  Rewards
        1.  After practice, reward yourself
2.  [Super Scanners](http://get.gg/docs/SuperScanner.pdf)
    - Notice the scanner (high sensitivity to something): "That's that
      (super-sensitive) scanner again!"
    - Adjust the sensitivity dial: "Okay, the scanner is noticing the
      ………(physical sensations). I'm thinking the worst about that, but
      it's probably just a normal body sensation. The other symptoms are
      due to anxiety."
    - No need to fight the thoughts, be mindful and let them pass
    - Change your focus of attention: Move on – do or think about
      something else
