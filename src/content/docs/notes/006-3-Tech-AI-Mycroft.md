## FAQ

### Run self-hosted?

Possible with replacing these 3 services offered by home.mycroft.ai.

- Backend services options:
  - [Selene](https://github.com/MycroftAI?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=Selene)
  - [Personal Backend](https://github.com/MycroftAI/personal-backend) -
    developed by community
- Speech Recognition, Speech to Text (STT) options:
  - [Mozilla DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases)
  - [Kaldi](https://kaldi-asr.md/)
  - Mycroft AI believes these are not sufficient for mainstream use yet
- Speech-synthesis, Text to Speech (TTS) options:
  - Use the British Male Voice
  - Other realistic voices require Mycroft servers

Configure them in the [mycroft.conf
file](https://mycroft-ai.gitbook.io/docs/using-mycroft-ai/customizations/mycroft-conf)

### Wake Word Issues?

Workarounds include:

- Using custom wake words
- Check audio issues

### Response times?

- Depends on system resources, network, streaming STT, dialog, TTS cache
  for common generated phrases

### My own TTS voice?

- Possible, estimate weeks to months and is a significant amount of work

## Get Mycroft - Linux

[Install on
Linux](https://mycroft-ai.gitbook.io/docs/using-mycroft-ai/get-mycroft/linux)

### Prerequisites

- Linux
- Internet connection
- Terminal
- Microphone, speakers
- `git`

### System Requirements

- [Precise](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-precise#mycroft-precise)
  wake word engine uses TensoFlow:
  - On x86 Intel Processes, requires Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX)
    support. Check it is available with `grep avx /proc/cpuinfo` and
    will return output if install. If nothing, it is not installed
  - If AVX is not available, Mycroft can use PocketSphinx, a
    disadvantage is it is less precise

## Installation

### Using Git

``` bash
# Upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core.git
cd mycroft-core
# Run script to install all dependencies and Mycroft
bash dev_setup.sh
```

The script will:

- Identify, install and configure dependencies. For Debian/Fedora, it
  will use apt, dnf respectively.

- Install and configure `virtualenv`, a Python tool for isolated
  environments to manage dependencies and security.

- My settings:

  - Use dev branch to troubleshoot skill issues
  - Do not build mimic (I will do it later)
  - Do not add Mycroft bin to PATH
  - Skills at: /opt/mycroft/skills

``` bash

created by the install script.

e.g.Â =./start-mycroft.sh all=

`stop-mycroft.sh` will stop Mycroft services.

[Pair your device with
home.mycroft.ai](https://mycroft-ai.gitbook.io/docs/using-mycroft-ai/pairing-your-device)

[See GitHub Readme for further configuration
information](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core)

`mycroft-cli-client` in bin folder will start a command interface
showing logs like DEBUG, skills, voice and text feedback from Mycroft.

### Keep Mycroft Updated

``` bash

cd ~/mycroft-core # or wherever you installed Mycroft
# Ensure Mycrofy is stopped
./stop-mycroft.sh
# Stash your configurations
git stash
# Pull the latest changes, likely the dev branch
git pull
# Restore your configurations
git stash pop
# Update your virtualenv
./update_dev.sh
# Restart mycroft
./start-mycroft.sh all

```
