## Use Case - Telling a Story with Data

Know the users, audience for a report/dashboard and their needs and
their questions. Support data exploration and analysis.

## Design factors for Business Intelligence (BI)

- Audience - user groups
- Platform - mobile, embedded, public, print, holographic, tablet, other
- User experience (UI/UX)- layout, colour, brand, Accessibility,
  performance (latency, responsive)
- Data analysis - data model, visualizations, queries (PowerBI DAX)

## Design Process using Design Thinking

1.  Understand users and their problems
2.  Gather other requirements
3.  Design and idea creation
    - Sketching and layout with users, data visualizations, potential
      queries
    - Add platform features, branding
4.  Test, iterate with users
5.  Deploy

## Design System

If available, reuse an existing design system with these elements:

- Colours - minimize contrast
- Typography - font, text, page templates with components
- Page Dimensions: width, scrolling
- Spacing: between sections, visualizations, margins
- Notes: placements and colours of call outs
- Tables: style preset, row padding
- Text blocks: reading width

## Power BI Features

Q: Should you use single visual reports? Pin the visual instead of the
page. Avoid single visual report tiles due to lack of caching.

Q: How to version control Power BI files? Power BI supports git version
control.
