Example Anki flash cards in Emacs

## How to Use this File

- Activate `anki-editor-mode`

- Use `anki-editor-insert-note` to create a new card. Prefer the "3. All
  Purpose Card" note type

- Use `anki-editor-push-notes` to push all cards to Anki

- Issues:

  - If images are not copied over check `anki-editor-mode` is activated,
    then push cards again per
    <https://github.com/louietan/anki-editor/issues/30>

### Learning how to learn - chunk library <span class="tag" tag-name="learn2learn"><span class="smallcaps">learn2learn</span></span>

1.  Front (Example with word blanked out or missing)

    A <u>\_\_\_\_\_</u> of chunks helps combine chunks in new and
    creative ways. The concept of <u>\_\_\_\_\_</u> is making connection
    between chunks across disciplines that helps with problem solving.

3.  Front (Definitions, base word, etc.)

4.  Back (a single word/phrase, no context)

    - Library of chunks - A person learns chunks over time and can be
      combined for problem solving and applications
    - Transfer - when the library can help with learning related chunks
      in other disciplines

5.  \- The full sentence (no words blanked out)

6.  \- Extra Info (Pronunciation, personal connections, conjugations,
    etc)

    - Application of chunks and solutions:
      - Sequential: step by step
      - Holistic (global): intuition and diffuse thinking

### Learning How to Learn - Mindset <span class="tag" tag-name="learn2learn"><span class="smallcaps">learn2learn</span></span>

1.  Front (Example with word blanked out or missing)

    What are pros and cons of the following?

    - Overlearning
    - Einstellung (German for "mindset")
    - Interleaving

4.  Back (a single word/phrase, no context)

5.  \- The full sentence (no words blanked out)

    - **Overlearning** = When learning something, sometimes we
      learn/practice it over and over again
      - Practice and repetition improves idea and connections
        - Should focus on difficult topics - deliberate practice
      - Overlearning is not useful if repeating something you already
        know well or is easy which creates an illusion of competence
    - **Einstellung** - German for "mindset"
      - Can be like a road block
      - When you have a solution to a problem or intuition, you may not
        see other solutions as you keep using the same pattern
      - Overlearning can lead to Einstellung
    - **Interleaving** - practice using different patterns / approaches
      to different problems is best way to learn and prevent a fixed
      mindset
      - It can be hard
      - Practice selecting different chunks, mix up learning
      - Builds flexibility and creativity and allows independent
        thinking

6.  \- Extra Info (Pronunciation, personal connections, conjugations,
    etc)

    Application:

    - Allows cross-discipline application of knowledge
      - Though weaknesses of generalization apply
      - Specialization offers depth, but can cause Einstellung
    - Thomas S Kuhn in "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"
      discovered that most paradigm shifts in sciences were discovered
      by younger people or people originally trained in another field.
      - These people are less easily trapped by Einstellung
      - People used to old ways gradually leave the field, allowing
        changes

    - Practice makes it easier, even when there are many concepts and
      chunks to take it
    - Repeated effort will make things easier
