## Do Anywhere Tough Workout

workout moves, various slides

### Tricep Step-Ups

This movement from the FIRE workout video builds, strengthens and
sculpts lean and toned abdominals, shoulders and triceps. HOW TO DO IT:
Start in the high plank position with both arms locked out, your back
straight and aligned, and your core tight and strong. Without crumbling
your midsection, come down on your forearms, one forearm at a time and
hold here. Now, from the forearm plank position, move back up into the
high plank position, one arm at a time. Repeat by alternating your
leading arm. "It's important to keep your neck long and your core
steady. Don't sacrifice form for speed," says trainer Nicky Holender. To
modify, do the movement from your knees instead of your toes.

### Breakdance thruster: standing to high plank to breakdance one foot one hand opposites

While it's definitely one of the toughest moves, it's also considered
one of the most fun to do. Breakdance Thrusters from the SOLDIER workout
are a full body movement that calls on your neurological strength and
memory. This move develops skill and overall coordination. HOW TO DO IT:
From the standing position, bend down putting your hands on the ground
and jump your feet back so that you're in a plank position. Next, step
one foot out to the side and bring the opposite leg under your body
while lifting up the arm opposite to that leg. From here, kick back to a
push-up position and then jump up to standing again. The key is to keep
arms and legs as straight as possible when extended…and to have fun! To
modify this movement, you can step one leg back at a time (instead of a
full jump). Once done, repeat using opposite side.

Variation

Go front support, back support, front support etc.

### Pike push ups: Inverted pike bent knees to bent arms

A deceiving movement, this exercise from the IRON workout video doesn't
look difficult, but it'll call on all of your focus and strength to
complete. Pike Push-ups are an upper body exercise, giving you toned and
sculpted shoulders. HOW TO DO IT: Form an inverted V with your body by
placing your hands on the ground, coming up on your toes and slightly
bending your knees. From here, drive your head straight down towards the
ground by bending your arms. Once you've gone as close as you can to the
floor, come back up to the top of the inverted V. TIP: Keep your eyes
focused on your shoelaces; this will keep your neck in the correct
position. To modify, do the movement from your knees instead of your
toes. If you're feeling like an extra challenge (kudos to you!) lift one
of your legs up behind you – your back and leg should form a straight
line. Repeat on the other side.

Shoulder series: shoulder rotations, then to goal post with 90 degree
arms front and back rotations, then to highway signalling arms up and
down, then to wring it out with rotating arm to front and back.

The intent of this exercise is to warm-up for your shoulders, but as the
heat builds – it becomes a challenging move in itself. The shoulder
series helps you develop stronger shoulders, which help frame the body
making your waist look smaller. HOW TO DO IT: The Shoulder Series is a
5-part exercise with 30 seconds of each movement (2 and a half minutes
to complete the entire series). Start with Circles Forward/Back – the
simple arm circles you remember from gym class. To do the next movement,
Goal Post, create a 90-degree angle with your elbows bent at your side.
Move your arms forward and down so they're parallel with the floor and
then back up. Next is Thumbs Together which involves bringing your arms
up from the bent goal post position at your sides to directly overhead,
touching your thumbs. Next, extend your arms straight out at your sides
and Wring It Out by slightly rotating your entire arm to the front and
then the back. Lastly, move into Pull Back by extending both arms out
straight and pulling them toward the back of the room, repeating in
pulses.

### Fish out of water: side crunch with arm stabilizer

This isolated abdominal exercise requires only a small range of motion
but delivers big results. This exercise from the IRON workout video
builds overall core strength while toning your oblique and intercostal
abdominal muscles. HOW TO DO IT: Start on the floor on your side (you
may need a mat). Straighten the arm on the floor so that it extends
above your head and place your opposite hand on the floor (for balance).
Next, your straight-arm hand should come up slightly "waving at your
feet" and at the same time, your feet should lift up off the floor to
"wave at your hand." Once done, repeat on your opposite side. To modify,
bend your bottom arm so that your hand is now supporting your head when
it's elevated. Also, you can bend the knee of your bottom leg (putting
your leg behind you) for added support and balance.

### Hindu push-up: inverted V pike with bent knees plank, dive towards floor, then swing head up between arms. Body ends in arch and go backwards.

Another movement that will call on your focus and strength, the Hindu
Push-up works your chest and shoulders while building strength and range
of motion. HOW TO DO IT: Start in an inverted V by putting your hands on
the ground, coming up on your toes and slightly bending your knees. From
here, dive your head down towards the ground and then swing your head
through between your arms with your body following. Once your body has
moved through, you should end with your head and then body moving into
an arch. From here, push your body back into the inverted V position and
repeat. To modify, do this movement from your knees.

### Split jumps: lunge, jump up and switch legs (mountain climbers). Knees stay above toes at lowest level.

This plyometric movement works your glutes and builds explosive power.
It'll challenge you and as Nicky says, "It'll burn so good." HOW TO DO
IT: First do a lunge by starting in a standing position and then placing
one foot behind you and lower your legs and body so that your back knee
almost "kisses" the ground. Just as you reach this point, jump your body
up and switch legs and move back into the lunge position on the opposite
side and repeat. You can use your arms to help jump you up and keep your
balance. TIP: Don't let your knee to go past toes in the lunge position
and keep your chest upright. To modify this movement, step back into the
lunge (don't jump) and then come back into standing and repeat.

### Full leg circles

This movement tests your balance and improves your range of motion while
engaging your glutes, abdominal and leg muscles. HOW TO DO IT: Put your
arms out to your sides for balance. Stand on one leg and lift your other
leg, bending at the knee. From here, extend the bent leg straight out
and then rotate this straight leg out, around and back behind you before
finally bringing down to the ground and repeat. Once done, repeat on the
other side.

### Circular mountain climber: high plank to legs alternating jump close to arms on the side.

You may have heard of mountain climbers but, Nicky's souped-up version
takes it up a notch. Circular Mountain Climbers increase range or motion
in your lower body and help tone quads and abdominal muscles. HOW TO DO
IT: Start in the high plank position and then take one foot and swing it
out and around to the hand on that same side, getting as close to your
hand as possible. Next, swing the foot back to center and immediately
hop your other foot out and around to the hand on that same side.
Continue this back and forth motion. To modify this move, remove the
hop; just step your foot up toward your hand and then step it back to
push-up position.

### Plank jump runs: plank to jump feet close to hands (all 4s), then run back feet to plank

An overall kick-your-butt cardio exercise, Plank Jump Runs will get your
heart rate up in no time and the interval structure of the workout will
keep you burning calories even after you're done working out. HOW TO DO
IT: Start in the plank position with arms and legs fully extended. Next,
simultaneously jump your feet up towards your hands and once they land,
run them back until fully extended and then repeat. To modify, do a
small jump forward, not all the way toward your feet.

### Single leg jump squat: tippy toes on one leg, squat, touch floor with hands.

The movement is just like it sounds. The Single Leg Jump Squat in the
EXPLOSION workout helps you develop explosive power while toning and
strengthening your quads. HOW TO DO IT: From a standing position,
slightly lift one foot off the ground behind you and then squat down and
touch the ground with your hand. From the ground, come back up with a
jump and then return to standing – and repeat. To modify, keep your back
foot on the ground for balance (like a kickstand on a bike). Once done,
repeat using opposite leg.

Rain dance warrior: Extend both arms with a bend in the elbow over your
head and then sink your lower body down into the squat position while
keeping your chest upright. From here, you jump and squat, jump and
squat while turning your body in a circle. Once you've done completed a
circle, reverse the direction.

This movement may be the genesis of Nicky Holender's most famous line,
"If those legs are shakin', those calories are bakin'." Targeting both
your upper and lower body, this exercise promises to strengthen and tone
your quads and shoulders all in one movement. While it may not be the
toughest move to execute, it is one of the toughest moves to stick with
until the end. We can practically guarantee you'll be raining sweat when
it's done. HOW TO DO IT: Extend both arms with a bend in the elbow over
your head and then sink your lower body down into the squat position
while keeping your chest upright. From here, you jump and squat, jump
and squat while turning your body in a circle. Once you've done
completed a circle, reverse the direction. To modify this movement,
remove the jump between squats.

### Burpee tuck jumps: burpee (standing, push up, lower to ground), tuck jump

This exercise, found in the WARRIOR workout video, is what trainer Nicky
Holender calls "the mother of all burpees." Burpee Tuck Jumps are not
for the faint of heart. It's a full body movement that helps build
explosive power while burning through calories. HOW TO DO IT: Do a
burpee by lowering your hands to the ground, kick your feet out to a
plank position and then lower your chest to the ground (as you advance
through the program, the speed of this part improves). Once lying flat,
quickly lift your chest back up and kick your feet up near your hands
and underneath your body. Begin to stand but as you do, jump and tuck
both legs underneath your body. When you land, go back into the burpee
position and repeat. To modify this movement, step your legs out in the
burpee movement and instead of a tuck jump, do a small hop and raise
your arms.

### Spider hops in all directions / Lateral Plank pops: extended plank, pop with hips and arms to left and right alternating.

As if planking isn't challenging enough, STRONGER trainer Nicky Holender
takes it up a notch again by adding in a "pop." This is a movement he
has all of this top athletes doing, and it'll work your core, triceps
and shoulders. HOW TO DO IT: Start in the plank position. With a slight
pop in your hips, jump your entire body to the right and then back to
the left while keeping a solid push-up/extended plank position the
entire time. If you're really advanced, move your body in a box shape
(forward, side, back, side). To modify this exercise, from the plank
position, walk your right hand and right leg out to the right and then
walk them back towards the left and repeat.

### Single leg tuck jumps: From the standing position, do a tuck jump by jumping in the air and tucking one leg up and under your body and keep your other leg straight. Quiet controlled landing.

This exercise is most likely the toughest movement in the Stronger
program. Single Leg Tuck Jumps whip your lower body into shape focusing
in on your quads, calves and hip flexors. HOW TO DO IT: From the
standing position, do a tuck jump by jumping in the air and tucking one
leg up and under your body and keep your other leg straight. When you
land, come down on the straight leg and then immediately jump back up
into the tuck jump. Once done, repeat using opposite leg. The key is to
pull your knee up as high as you can on the jump and to have a quiet,
controlled landing. To modify this movement, lift your "tucked" leg up
near your opposite knee and do small, controlled hops.

## Abdominal exercises

For crunches, keep your head pointed toward the ceiling.

## Footnotes

Function of The Core/Ab Muscles:

Stabilize the spine, Flex the spine, rotate the spine, extend the hips.
Do these four things to work core and abdominal muscles.

| **Action** | **Example Exercise**             |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| Stabilize  | Plank, bridge                    |
| Flex       | Crunch, sit up                   |
| Rotate     | Russian twist                    |
| Extend     | One sided bridge, prone superman |

Your core has to be trained in order to be able to use the strength,
power and endurance that you develop in your other muscles. If your core
is weak then loads aren't transferred properly and that will lead to
inefficient movement and even injury and low back pain.

This routine is progressive for core/ab area. It can be performed a
couple times a week and you will always be doing a
plank/flex/bridge/rotate move each week. You may not be able to progress
each week…that's OK! Or on the other-hand you may notice that some moves
are just too easy and in that case you will want to start at a more
progressed movement. Here are some general rules for the routine.

- For planks and bridging moves, the goal is to work your way up to 1
  minute. If you can't quite do 1 minute yet then great…you are like
  most of us! In this case, hold the plank/bridge for 10 seconds, rest
  for a moment and then repeat for 12 repetitions.
- When performing these moves, practice "drawing in" and "bracing".
  Drawing in is pulling your belly-button inward and bracing is
  contracting you abs and butt muscles
- Perform the exercises in a circuit fashion for up to 3 sets. Flexing
  and rotating moves should be done slowly for 12-20 reps. Goals for
  planking/bridging is to work up to 1 minute.
- If you don't want a dedicated core/ab day then just work through 1 row
  for 1 set prior to your normal workout.
