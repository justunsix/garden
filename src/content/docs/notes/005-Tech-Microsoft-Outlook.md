- In Outlook, create a new message and format it as a template. Save it
  as a draft
- Open the draft message, use file \> save as, then choose format type
  as "Outlook Template"
- The file manager should save the template automatically to
  `$env:APPDATA\Roaming\Microsoft\Template` which is the user's app data
  folder like `C:\Users\myusername\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates`
  on Windows.
- You can reuse templates saved in the folder in the Outlook desktop
  application

## Finding the Folder that Contains a Message

If you’ve ever tried to find a folder you’d created in Outlook.

Use Case:

- You go to a file or retrieve an email message in Outlook and can’t
  remember the name of the subfolder you put it in, or you can’t
  remember the location of the subfolder.
- Outlook allows you to search messages and can tell you the name of the
  folder where they’re stored, but it doesn’t show the folder path,
  where it’s located.

If you want to know the exact full folder path of a message, find the
message via Advanced Find.

1.  Double click on the message to open it in its own window.
2.  Open the Advanced Find feature via the keyboard shortcut
    CTRL+SHIFT+F
3.  The "Look in" field will reveal the folder name to you and clicking
    on the Browse button will show you where in that is exactly in your
    folder hierarchy.

Via Advanced Find, you can determine the exact folder path of an opened
message.
