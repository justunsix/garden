Parent/teacher proactive and empowering responses include:

- Undue Attention: Redirect by involving child in a useful task to gain
  useful attention; ignore (touch without words); say what you will do,
  "I love you and \_\_." (Example: I care about you and will spend time
  with you later.”) Avoid special service; have faith in child to deal
  with feelings (don't fix or rescue); plan special time; set up
  routines; engage child in problem-solving; use family/class meetings;
  set up nonverbal signals.
- Misguided Power: Redirect to positive power by asking for help; offer
  limited choices; don't fight and don't give in; withdraw from
  conflict; be firm and kind; act, don't talk; decide what you will do;
  let routines be the boss; leave and calm down; develop mutual respect;
  set a few reasonable limits; practice follow-through; use family/class
  meetings.
- Revenge: Acknowledge hurt feelings; avoid feeling hurt; avoid
  punishment and retaliation; build trust; use reflective listening;
  share your feelings; make amends; show you care; act, don't talk;
  encourage strengths; put kids in same boat; use family/class meetings.
- Assumed: Break task down to small steps; stop all criticism; encourage
  any positive attempt; have faith in child's abilities; focus on
  assets; don't pity; don't give up; set up opportunities for success;
  teach skills/show how, but don't do for; enjoy the child; build on
  his/her interests; use family/class meetings.

## Encouraging Statements for any goal

- Would you be willing to work with me to figure out whether you'd like
  to improve your grade, and if so, how you could go about that?
- When you've put away the equipment, we can move on to the next
  activity.
- Let's try it this week for a week, and then we can think about it
  (re-evaluate).
- You can try again
- I'll let you know when I'm ready to try again.
- I wonder what you're so upset, angry, hurt, annoyed, etc. about
- Wow! You're really angry, annoyed, etc. Want to tell me about it.
- I feel <u>\_\_</u> because <u>\_\_</u> and I wish <u>\_\_</u>.
- Pencil. Quiet. Later. Recess. (One word!)
- I can tell this is really important to you.
- I can see how hard you worked on this and how much time went into it.
