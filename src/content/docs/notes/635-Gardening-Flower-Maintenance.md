title: Flower Maintenance
---

Instructions are provided in context of maintaining flowers in an indoor
religious space.

Tips will apply for most indoor flowers in a drier climate with cold and
hot seasons.

## Aesthetics & Colours

Every flower carries a significance and meaning. In the Christian
heritage, flowers

have been an expression of certain virtues. Colours too have meanings,
especially within

the liturgical calendar, and some carry personal significance. All fresh
flowers and new

plants are opportunities for not only enhancing church worship but
expressing our desires,

faith, remembrances and love.

The aesthetic of beauty and design also has its place and its particular
integrity on

the altar. Does the display enhance devotion or distract from it? The
patterns of flowers

should draw the eye towards the tabernacle and highlight the sacred
functions of the

reader’s podiums. Sometimes less is better under these circumstances.
The combination

of flowers and colours should work as a theme and contribute their
energies to the whole

congregation. Not all flowers and colours go together, of course. For
instance, a carnation

family does not complement a lily family and visa versa. Because flowers
form a visual

prayer, a prayer of quiet beauty is a call to contemplation. One or two
colours (one of

these being neutral, like white) usually assists the aesthetic.

To Prolong Life

\\ For fresh flowers the best are the lily family and the carnation
family. Roses can

last a week or ten days but only if white or pink (and need warm water
to open).

Red roses last only a few days and are usually not a good choice.

\\ Tepid-cold water is best, half full vases with only the stems
immersed.

(NB if any leaves get into the water it turns it rancid and poisons the
flowers.

This also applies to green adornments – only stems of ferns etc in
water).

\\ Lily stamens to be snipped when open.

\\ During the first week of display, fresh cool water to be added to
original water.

\\ Every subsequent week, completely change the water, snip bottom of
stems and

drop an aspirin in (or plant food).

\\ For bouquets in oasis (green foam) the oasis needs full watering
every day or

it will dry out and the flowers cannot be revived. In the case of an
oasis display

(usually from a florist for a funeral or wedding) it is advisable to
redistribute and

re-arrange the flowers in vases within a few days to last.

\\ For long-term plants, one fertilizer stick per month (in summer),
every second

month in winter. Spray leaves and cut all dry tips or wilting flowers,
if applicable.

\\ Short term plants (i.e. flowering pots) water and spray and cut away
any decay.
