  (GHGs)

### Advantages of Physical Commute

- Health benefits, active commute can increase productivity by 15%
- A commute can:
  - Create psychological, physical, and behavioural boundaries between
    work and home life.
  - Prevent role spillover
- Public transit reduces exposure to pollution compared to driving

### How to combine physical and hybrid commute? "Fake commute" concept

- Separate work space/time and home life: example, stop at times and add
  30 mins of other activity like 30 minutes of exercise
- Promotes active lifestyle, could start on a weekend to test it out

### Social Benefits of Commuting

- Active commute increases trust and social capital
  - Sweden study - car commuting saw opposite results - driving caused
    less trust in people
  - Active / public commute involves direct people interaction that
    increases trust
- Experiment - talking to strangers can help you and others feel goods
  including strangers
- Group commute - walking or cycling group with your coworkers
- "Trip-chaining"
  - Running errands on your commute reduces GHG emissions and also helps
    support the local economy.
  - Combine transportation to multiple places

### Putting it all together

- Have lunch with a co-worker, walk/active transit with them
- Bring kids to school, get together with parents and transit together
  like walking
- Work outside your home with an active trip and support local business

### Productivity

> Productivity isn't everything, but in the long run it is almost
> everything. A country's ability to improve its standard of living over
> time depends almost entirely on its ability to raise its output per
> worker.

-Paul Krugman The Age of Diminishing Expectations (1994 Nobel Prize in
Economics 2008

- The cost of "productivity" example - Between Feb-Oct 2020, who left
  and joined the Canadian labour force:
  - 20,600 women left (likely due to caregiving)
  - +68,000 men joined
- Measuring success:
  - Plan - Speak to team
  - Do - Start small
  - Check - Measure numbers or stories
  - Act - Repeat

### Supporting Employees in Remote Work

- 50 to 55 mins meeting gaps
- Less meetings
- More informal conversations
- Audio better than video, allows physical flexibility like care give
  and walking
- Core business hours (shorter hours for meetings to allow personal work
  time)
- Just ask

## "Hotelling" & Hot Desking 101 - Smart Commute Toronto - 2021-11-30

Presented by Adrienne

### Open office

- Dedicated to each person, space efficient if everyone attends the
  office
- If workforce is only occasionally there:
  - Not efficient
  - Isolating
  - Requires space coordination
  - Physical distancing

### Trends of 2022

- Increased virtual & hybrid meetings
- Work from home for focus time & solo tasks
  - Need quiet area for short calls
- Office for collaborative tasks & social time

  - Unassigned spaces
  - First come first served
  - Flexible
  - Not best for all situations
  - Issues:
    - Preferred spaces hogged by employees
    - Uncertainty where to go
- Hoteling
  - Reserved space ahead of time
  - Find desks near teammates with special equipment
  - Can make neighbourhoods for teams that work together
  - Like booking a meeting room
  - Good for:
    - Distancing
    - Track occupancy and transparency
    - Geographical flexibility
  - Poor for:
