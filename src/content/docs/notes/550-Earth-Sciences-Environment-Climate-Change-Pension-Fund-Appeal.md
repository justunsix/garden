## Take Action Now to Protect Your Pension and the Climate

I am a beneficiary of \[your pension fund will go here\] and I am deeply
concerned about climate change and the risks it poses for the future.

It is clear that the climate crisis requires pension funds to reconsider
how they can meet their fiduciary duty to beneficiaries like me.
Investing in the long-term best interests of plan members requires
shifting holdings away from fossil fuels and into profitable climate
solutions while taking all steps necessary to prepare for the
significant and growing risks of climate change.

I have the expectation that my pension fund will work hard to protect my
retirement savings from these growing risks, but also to invest in a
climate-safe world and a zero-carbon economy.

I'm concerned that \[your pension fund will go here\] may be lagging
behind in taking the ambitious action required to address the climate
crisis. I am writing to request more information on the activities my
pension fund is taking to manage climate risk while ensuring my
retirement savings are being invested responsibly. I want to know if
timelines and measurable goals have been introduced to reduce climate
risk, cut carbon from the \[your pension fund will go here\] portfolio,
and significantly increase investments in profitable zero-carbon climate
solutions.

I would have much more confidence in \[your pension fund will go
here\]'s investment strategy if there were more transparency as to
whether or not \[your pension fund will go here\] has timelines and
measurable goals to: a) reduce climate-related financial risks, b) cut
carbon emissions from its portfolio to net zero, and c) significantly
increase investments in profitable zero-carbon climate solutions.

In particular, I expect that \[your pension fund will go here\] will
show it understands climate risk by acting rapidly to:

1.  Immediately disclose:

2.  a complete list of assets under management that are aligned with a
    zero-carbon economy by mid-century at the latest;

3.  a complete list of assets that are allocated to high-carbon
    investments like fossil fuel companies and infrastructure;

4.  Commit to aligning \[your pension fund will go here\]'s portfolio
    with Canada's commitment and the Paris agreement goal to limit
    global temperature increases to 1.5℃. Explain how any high-carbon
    investments are aligned with this goal;

5.  Immediately place an exclusionary screen on new oil, gas, coal and
    pipeline investments;

6.  Phase out all current oil, gas, coal and pipeline investments by
    2025;

7.  Decarbonize my pension portfolio by 2030;

8.  Establish ambitious targets for increased investments in profitable
    climate solutions;

9.  Develop a robust engagement strategy to ensure owned companies are
    on a rapid decarbonization pathway.

There is no time to waste. Every day, the climate crisis worsens, and
investments in fossil fuels become riskier. The required rapid
transition to a zero-carbon economy requires massive investments in
climate solutions, and I urge \[your pension fund will go here\] to show
new leadership.

I look forward to hearing from you with a response to how \[your pension
fund will go here\] is meeting my expectations. I hope we can work
constructively together to meet this challenge.

Sincerely, \> your name will go here \> your email address will go here
\> your location will go here
