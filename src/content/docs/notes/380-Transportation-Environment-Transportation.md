## Environment Smart Commute, Using Technology to Improve Your Commute - 2021-11-16

Presented by Julia Hamill, introduced by Kim Stemshorn

- Part of Toronto's climate action strategy to reduce Green House Gases
  (GHGs)

- Transport options: car, carpool, walk, bike

- Overview of apps and technologies to plan your trips

  - Google Maps
    - Avoid busy times and check when a public transit station is
      crowded or not crowded
      - See weekly statistics
    - Filter routes (bus, train, subways, transfer to drive/ride
      service)
    - Layers: Cycling, traffic, issues
      - Use cycling layer for checking best routes
      - Integrates with Bike Share to see stations (mobile only)
  - Smart Commute Tool
    - Best to see carpool or bike/walk partners
    - Track commutes/telework to see GHG, time savings
    - Connect apps to tool to help with logging
  - Triplinx.ca
    - Can combine walking and transit using options
  - All tools are accessible
  - Bike Share Toronto
    - Good for last step commutes to connect longer walking distances
      with transit
  - Mobile Apps for transit, all free:
    - Rocketman - provides real time bus schedule and volume, supports
      alerts
    - Transit App - same as Rocketman for real time
      - Integrates with Uber, car share information
      - Accessible
    - Citymapper
      - Suggest subway entrances
      - Helps walk routes and safer routes like main streets
      - Can work offline
    - Moovit
      - Real time

- Why optimize your commute?

  - Improve health
  - Increase quality of life
  - Help our city move better
  - Contribute to TransformTO's climate action goals
  - Through its [TransformTO climate action
    strategy](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/water-environment/environmentally-friendly-city-initiatives/transformto/)
    - City set two transportation-related goals
    - 2050 all vehicles in Toronto will use low-carbon energy
    - Net zero by 2040
    - 75% of all trips within 5km are done by walking, cycling, or on
      public transit.

- Example commutes: putting it all into action

  - Travel from York Mills to Bathurst and Bloor
    - Use subway, get off earlier
    - Use Bike Share stations closer and go rest of way
  - Oakville to Toronto:
    - Triplinx suggests use GO Transit and TTC default route
    - Start modifying Triplinx route:
      - Ask for fastest route
      - Add bike or not and bike network
      - Result is a new bike ride for a healthier commute and a shorter
        commute time
  - Mississauga to Vaughan
    - Smart Commute suggests a carpool as the fastest

- Feeling overwhelmed? How to get started!

  - Start small, pick one tool/technology
  - Invite a friend to try it out
  - Practice

- Q&A

  - Bike locker program with City of Toronto, also bike stations
    monitored at City Hall, Union and Finch
  - Bike can be brought on GO train, exception is peak hours/peak
    routes. Same with TTC. Foldable bikes are allowed carried
  - Inter regional trips recommendations:
    - Google Maps and Triplinx were best in past
    - Carpool
      - Smart Commute app can filter and keep things private. It is best
        to meet the person first such as a coffee to talk about
        expectations, rules (where to meet, late, stops on the way)
  - Emergency trip - \$75 for reimbursement for certain emergencies
    (e.g. sickness)
