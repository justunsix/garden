## Introduction

These areas all reinforce focus of an athlete.

Focus = what your thinking and feeling now, in the moment = confident,
relaxed, positive thoughts

- Dealing with Distractions: handling things that get in the way
- Setting Effective Goals: realistic for different time periods
- Visualization: imagining using senses

## Types of Focus

- Broad (many cues), narrow (few cues)
- External, internal to observer and their environment

## Focus Plans

Detailed plans setting out when and how athletes will work on things
they need to think about and feel to perform well

## Using Focus Plans

### Development/Revising a Focus Plan

- Meet with your athletes: get their input, engage them, identify what
  to work on (relaxation, anxiety, injury)
- Educate about focus: what is it, how to plan, why it matters, need for
  training
- Ask athletes good questions: to build a focus plan by asking about
  thoughts and feelings on doing well
  - What is a good performance? Not so great performance?
  - Their preferred focus? Focus on internal/external cues
  - What do you need to perform well by:
    - Thinking/feeling
    - Executing strategies
    - Facing opponents
    - Deal with distractions

"A good well-trained focus plan creates a confident athlete, because
he/she knows and has trained what to be thinking and feeling""

## Visualization = Blueprint for ideal performance

A skill that allows athletes to create a blueprint of how they want to
be, what they want to be focused on. Create positive reality, gives
confidence.

One rule: only positive visualization

Each athlete is different in applying visualization (e.g. thinking vs
more feeling)

### Practice tips

- Put visualization in daily training
- Start with something successful, then more to challenging situations
  and eventually competitions.
- Do a non-sport visualization activity (see coach reference material).
  Ask about:
  - Who, what, when, where
  - Equipment
  - Look, Colours, Feel, Hear, Smell
  - Body and muscle sense
  - Result
  - Fears, pressure

## Dealing with Distractions

There are many! Controllable and cannot be controlled.

Coping with emotions after a concussion can be distraction, let its
course go (mourning, sadness, move on).

### Focus Examples

- Focus on an object, do things to a timing
- Focus on cues (e.g. from people)
- Concentration words
- Relaxation techniques
- Positive self talk
- Recognize negative thoughts (they are normal) stop negative thoughts
  and replace them

### Controlling intensity

- Control intensity appropriate for sport (aggressive/high energy for
  basketball, calm and focused for racing, calm and total focus for
  artistic)

- Place intensity feeling/thought in focus plan. There is an ideal for
  every athlete (not too little or too much).

## Setting Effective Goals

- Set goals with athletes and support them
- Goals important for injury recovery

### Types of goals

Process goals help achieve performance goals which can achieve outcomes.
Outcomes are out of direct athlete control.

## Debriefing Performance

Debriefing tells how well athletes are applying their focus plan.

- Coach facilitates athlete's/team's discovery of the best focus.
- What went well and not well?
- Cover all part of performance (physical, psychological, other).
- Listen non judgementally

Ask "what?", then "so what?" questions and finally "now what?"
questions.

- What did you feel So, what did you learn?
- What was your subjective 1 to 10 for \_?
- What distractions did you handle? So, what conclusions make sense?
- Now, what should we do differently \_?
- Now, what if \_?

See coach materials for questions, discussion topics (feelings, beliefs,
flexibility, applying something, predictions, timing)

Ask specific questions for specific situations and focus
