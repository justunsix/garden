## Creating Compilations

- Prepare Your Clips: Import all the video clips you want to use into
  Kdenlive.
- Create Multiscreen Layout:
  - Go to the Project Bin and right-click to add a new Video Track.
    You’ll need four tracks for a 2x2 layout.
  - Place each video clip on a separate track, aligning them on the
    timeline where you want them to play simultaneously.
- Resize and Position Clips:
  - Select a clip, go to the Effects tab, and add the Transform effect.
  - Use the Position and Size parameters to resize each clip to half the
    width and half the height of the project resolution.
  - Position each clip so that they form a 2x2 grid.
- Add Text Overlays:
  - Use the Title tool to create text overlays. You can access this tool
    from the Project Menu or the toolbar.
  - Create a title clip for each source and place it above the
    corresponding video clip on the timeline.
  - Adjust the position and size of the text within the title clip
    editor to fit within the boundaries of the video it corresponds to.
- Export Your Video: Once you’re satisfied with the compilation, go to
  Render and choose your desired output settings to export your final
  video.
