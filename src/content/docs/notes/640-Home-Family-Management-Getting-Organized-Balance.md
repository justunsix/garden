title: Getting Organized, Finding Balance

Source: my notes from a Telus Health educational session

## Learning goals

- Assess your organization
- Plan, get resources, do it
- Get organized in life (home, work)

## Use Case for Organization

- Make room for physical and mental freedom
- Improve health: reduce stress, safer spaces
- Help with relationships
- Clean, appearance, save money

## Background

Statistics support:

- Removing unnecessary cluster can reduce housework
- Clutter can be caused be disorganization
- Planning can reduce: redundancy later on, waiting for information,
  lack of preparation
  - "A stitch in time, saves nice"
  - "Measure twice, cut once" - carpentry/construction

### Challenges to Organization

- Life situations
  - Family members
- Habits
- History, family - how you are raised
- Health (physical, mental)
  - Indecision, perfectionism
  - Body issues

## Assess Your Organization

- Are you looking for things?
  - Can you find important things?
- How much clutter is around?
- How does your organization affect people relationships?
- Paying for storage space?
  - Good: free up space for other things, temporary use
  - Bad: encourages procrastination, cost, might be left for others to
    deal with

Understand:

- Organization is opinionated, a skill you can learn
- You can remain organized and keep everything accessible, it is not
  necessarily about removing things

## Getting Organized: Tools, Tips

- Book: The Complete Idiots Guides to Organizing Your Life
  - Get boxes, label them like donate, sell, keep, throw out
  - Plan:
    - Go room by room and evaluate
    - Put things in sorted boxes
      - Keep similar things together
    - Visualize your ideal space
- Sorting ideas, not absolutes:
  - Keep goals small (one room, part of a room)
  - Be simple
  - Don't need duplicates
  - Keep an empty space like a cabinet
  - Put everything in its place
  - Choose a thing, only sort one thing at a time and complete it
- Clean work area: only keep what you are working on at moment
