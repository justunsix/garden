## Homemade Fertilizer

It's made of dried egg shells, shrimp shells and coffee grounds. They
have to be well dried out though to avoid bad smells. Then I pulverize

## Food in Industrial and Developing Countries in 2011

From work Urban Gardeners session

- Industrial countries export processed food containing large amounts of
  salt, sugar, and fat.
- Global south exports "whole" foods at low costs: traditional farming
  vs. horticulture, argo culture, monoculture.
- Kenya is a good example.
- Climate, biofuels/energy, speculation in stocks and commodities leads
  to volatility, food crisis, diet changes resulting in health effects
  and prices.
- Ontario needs insurance against these global food challenges. Ontario
  is important many vegetables. If we grow ourselves, it will result in
  large revenues. Need to assess plant requirements and see if they can
  grow in Ontario and how many times during growth seasons.
  - Assess soil, water, light, maintenance (includes pest/physical),
    harvest
