## Methodology - To do list - List Management

Follow [todotxt](http://todotxt.md/) approach based on David Allen's
Getting Things Done.

1.  Priority - Set which tasks are important. e.g. A, B, C
2.  Project - break up large projects into tasks. e.g. +Project1,
    +Project2
3.  Context - place, situation, people to do tasks. e.g.
    \[cite/t:@Mary\], \[cite/t:@phone\], \[cite/t:@computer\]

[Explanation and syntax](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt)

Other items:

- Completion status and date
- Due date (optional)
- Create date (optional)
- Description of task (optional)

## Methodology - Significance

YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2X7c9TUQJ8)

In addition to rating tasks by urgency and importance, give yourself
emotional permission to also evaluate:

- Eliminate it / delegate it

- Its significance (make a better future) and ability to save time in
  future like through automation

- Leave it for later on purpose

- Think like a "multiplier". Example is investing money to make more
  money in future

## Methodology - Personal Kanban

Based on: Benson, Jim, and Tonianne DeMaria Barry. *Personal Kanban:
Mapping Work Navigating Life*. Modus Cooperandi Press, 2011.

Principles are below

### Rule 1: Visualize your work - for big picture, context

Columns of Kanban board:

1.  To do
2.  In progress (limit = \#)
3.  Today
4.  Waiting / In Pen
5.  Done

Plus an archive of past "done" cards

**Pull** work into your WIP. Do not let work be pushed to you.

### Rule 2: Limit your Work in Progress (WIP) - for focus and effectiveness, getting the right stuff done

For \#2, example is limit WIP to 4 items.

### Creating Backlog

- Only spend enough time on creating tasks to add value, do not over
  plan projects and sub tasks. Use **colours, shapes, etc.** to
  differentiate tasks
- Prioritise on urgent and important, then important but not urgent,
  then urgent and not important and finally, not important or urgent.
  - Ideal is important and not urgent for value and freedom

### Evaluation

- Consider using other columns related to WIP, such as today or a
  specific process step to measure process effectiveness and issues.
- Check cycle time (creation date to finish date) of tasks

Retrospectives:

- Subjective Wellbeing Box/Column - evaluate how you felt about tasks,
  add a note to them after completion and reflect on your feelings to
  check what to refuse/delegate/change/improve/balance in the future
- Retrospective column after done, each week reflect on completed tasks
  and learn from them
- Root cause of problems are often nested problems, so ask 5 (number
  depends on context) "whys" to get into the cause or use a Socratic
  method to question assumptions and beliefs

### Implementation
