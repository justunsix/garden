## Installing Rust on Windows without Rustup or Visual Studio

Before shell steps below, install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.md/). For
detailed steps, see the source video.

``` powershell

# Open a Windows terminal like in PowerShell or cmd
# Go into the UCRT64 system of MSYS2
ucrt64

```

Then install rust toolchain in MSYS2

``` shell

# Install rust toolchain
pacman --noconfirm -Syu mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-rust
# --noconfirm - do not prompt for confirmation
# mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-rust - installs rust compiler rustc, cargo

# Optionally, install rust-analyzer, a compilar frontend useful for development
pacman --noconfirm -Syu mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-rust-analyzer

```

To access the rust executables from Windows, add them to your user's
path. Find the MSYS2 binaries for the UCRT64 system. For example, if
MSYS2 was installed:

- With standard installer, the binary folder is `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin`
- By scoop, the binary folder is
  `C:\Users\yourusername\scoop\apps\msys2\current\ucrt64\bin`

``` powershell

# Add to user's path, use the path to the correct folder for your MSYS2 install
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $Env:Path + ";C:\Users\yourusername\scoop\apps\msys2\current\ucrt64\bin;C:\Users\yourusername\.cargo\bin", "User")
# Also adds the cargo binaries folder
# Close the shell session to see the new path

# In a new PowerShell session, check rust is installed
Get-Command rustc
Get-Command cargo

```

## Installing with Rustup

### Install Visual Studio Tools

This option only installs the command line tools which is smaller
instead of the full Visual Studio suite.

- Go to [Download Visual Studio Tools - Install Free for Windows, Mac,
  Linux](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- Scroll down and make sure Windows and C++ are clicked
- Scroll down to Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022 and Download and
  install it
- Start the installation, and choose Desktop C++ for the install tools

### Install with Rustup

- Install with [rustup.rs - The Rust toolchain
  installer](https://rustup.rs/)

### Optional: Install Tools

Install a rustfmt (formatter), clippy (linter), and rust-analyzer
(language server) to support development:

`rustup component add rustfmt clippy rust-analyzer`
