title: "Investigating the effect of Manitoba's province-wide physical
  education policy on secondary school students' physical activity: a
  natural experiment"

In fall 2008, Manitoba implemented a province-wide policy requiring a
physical education (PE) credit for students in grades 11 and 12, the
first of its kind in Canada. The PE curriculum requires grades 11 and 12
students to complete a minimum of 55 hours (50% of course hours) of
moderate to vigorous physical activity during the school semester to
achieve the course credit. The study being discussed during this session
examines the impact of this PE policy on secondary school students'
moderate to vigorous physical activity as a large natural experiment.
Findings can provide evidence about policy features that may improve the
PE policy in Manitoba and inform future PE policies in other
jurisdictions.

- 92% of youth are not meeting Canadian recommendations for activity (60
  mins per day)

- Girls slightly more inactive than boys. Adolescents slightly more
  inactive compared to younger children.

Study result:

- Data for future use
- PE policies are still relevant despite this one did not significantly
  affect results
- It was a natural experiment, so actual implementation was dependent on
  schools which could affect results

## Ability of schools to satisfy policies

CONTRIBUTION TO THE EVIDENCE BASE

- PE policy did not significantly improve students' MVPA

POSSIBLE EXPLANATION

- Issues with implementation across schools

POSSIBLE AMENDMENT

- Assessing intervention fidelity and reach, as well as various delivery
  models applied by schools

## Study Strength

- Natural experiment and quasi-experimental design
- Uses cross-sectional census survey data and objective measures of MVPA
- Parallel data from comparison provinces that did not enact a PE policy
- Includes follow-up data over a 4-year period

## Limitations

- Baseline differences between comparison and intervention samples on
  key characteristics known to associate with MVPA, such as sex, age,
  SES
- Some schools in comparison and intervention conditions did not
  participate in the survey data collections in Study 1 at baseline and
  follow-up
- No data identifying if student was enrolled in PE in the semester of
  follow-up data collections in Studies 1 or 2

## Presentation Summary

- First study to examine the effect of a province-wide secondary school
  PE policy on student MVPA
- PE policy did not significantly improve students' MVPA
- Provides evidence to inform current and future secondary school PE
  policies as well as future natural experimental studies of PE policies
- Conducting similar evaluations of large-scale PE interventions or
  policies in different settings would be valuable and further
  contribute to converging knowledge

## Questions

Is the policy implemented too late in life?

- MVPA declines on school entry and continues to decline in schooling

- Interventions should be done at school entry, through to adolescence+

Was ethnicity tracked?

- No - though would be interesting

What is "out" time?

- Not supervised by a teacher. It is signed by an adult so similar to a
  volunteer hours tracking.

- At 9-10 grades, feedback and out time was genuinely needed due to out
  of school activity

- Policy is specific in MVPA. Students were taught what it was, though
  it was student self reported.

What about early starts at school?

- Students are not randomized to conditions, so it was not possible to
  link ineffective results with conditions. It is possible things like
  busing affect physical activity (PA)

Any qualitative data?

- Barriers data

How could policy be made effective?

- Use study data to understand our current state and how to improve.
- Increase amount of time mandated in policy
- Increase in school PE credit
- Extend PE class to full year
