## Simplify your lifestyle

Source: [Rob Greenfield on How To Simplify Your
Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgcFxfL3MOc),

- What was your "ah ha moment"? Rob learned from people and reading that
  lifestyle was destroying the planet. Focus on solutions that are:
  - Just
  - Equitable
  - Sustainable
  - Simple living

### Simply living benefits

- Save money
  - Less to insure, maintain, buy
- Better usage of space
- Clearing your mind
  - Find purpose in experiences and relationships
- Save time
  - Less to clean, maintain, store things
- More time to do what you want
- Enjoy items you have more
- Better for environment
- Break free of social standards and corporate control

### Approach - minimizing and simplifying your life

- Make a list, make positive change, one at a time (1 per week, for 2
  years)
- Make things you don't want to do a burden, make things you want to do
  easy

Examples of changes:

- Start biking small distances to longer distances
- Food in bulk
- Examples of unnecessary items: some toiletries; deodorant, toner

### Ask questions with products and possessions

- Do I need/want it?
  - If not used in 6-12 months, probably not required
- Does this bring value to my life? Does this help to improve my quality
  of life? or opposite, does it harm my quality of life?
- Does it give value to others, the earth?
- Can a possession have multiple purposes?
- Can it be rented?

Process:

- Purge regularly (once per year)
- Start with easiest things to get rid of, build momentum on small
  things
- Buy used items if you're not sure you want it long term
- Buy new quality items
- Be ok with socially not having items (e.g. cars)

1.  Downsizing options

    - Exchanges
    - Donations
    - Sharing
    - Selling, auctions
    - Collections - libraries, shared used
    - Garage sale, free sale/giveaway party
    - Garbage

    Toilet paper plant: Plectranthus barbatus (common name: Blue Spur
    Flower)

    No shoes?

    - We have to move slower. Move the way your body is designed to
      move.
    - Avoid places like restaurants and malls
    - Avoid moving too quickly and having high shocks to our feet
      because of shoes

    Uncomfortable to be comfortable later examples

    - No phone - force presence
    - Car to bike - know limitations
    - No eating utensils - appreciate tools
    - Carrying your trash - awareness of waste

    Maintenance?

    - It will be hard to maintain the lifestyle due to being against
      society
