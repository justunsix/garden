## Career Paths Introduction

- Look at different paths, level, tasks and responsibilities, and skill
  of fields as of year 2023
- It is never too late to get into IT
- Popularity based on growth, pay/demand - IT engineers:
  - Software
  - DevOps
  - Cloud
  - Security
  - Data
  - Machine learning
- Lay out a map to learn these paths

### Learning Approach

- Try out multiple things, see options and opportunities, but do in
  structured learning

- Learn:

  - Programming basics - same for all languages
    - Suggestion: JavaScript / most popular language
      - Due to use of front and back end, mobile, and easier to learn
        than say Java
    - Learn end to end application development
      - Say web with HTML and CSS
      - Mobile app
      - Develop an application you can use rather than a tutorial
  - Concepts
  - Learning one path will help with other paths if you change your mind
    later
  - Learn one path at a time, at least 6 months at a time
  - Complete software development life cycle

## Software Engineering

- Common starting for IT careers - all software is developed by these
  people
- Can be entry level
- Many sub fields like:
  - Front end
  - Back end
  - Full stack (combination of front and back) - generalist
  - Web
  - Mobile app
  - Internet of Things (IoT)
  - Programming language, framework specialist
    - Java, JS, Py, Android, React.js

## DevOps Engineering

- Software engineer / system administration / networks / testers can
  transition to DevOps, recommended with IT background
- Automation of processes in software engineering

## Cloud Engineering

- Build and maintains infrastructure in cloud

- Can be entry level

- In demand due to migrations to cloud, can be related to DevOps

- How to started? learn popular cloud platforms like AWS, Microsoft
  Azure - get platform certifications (e.g. AWS cloud practitioner
  certificate

## Cyber Security

- Security is common to all IT fields due to need to secure sensitive
  data and affect all areas of IT
  - High demand and value due to cost of breaches
- Specialize in security
  - Identify issues, vulnerabilities
    - Multiple layers, people protection
  - Fix issues, test
  - Validate security
  - Secure organization
- Understand concept of what you are securing first like - network, data
  (like passwords), software
  - Sponsored technology: passbolt - opensource password manager with
    enterprise support

## Data Engineer

- Big data: media, apps, machine generated, high data growth each year
- Used for optimization, making decisions - data only has value after
  processing, analysis, and visualization and consumed by people like
  decision makers
- Data analyst - entry level
  - Analyze and interpret processed data
  - Skills of math and statistics, data visualization, tools (python,
    R), communication, business understanding
- Data engineer
  - Process data from base data
  - Skill examples
    - Programming: Python, Java, Scala
    - Database and queries: SQL
    - Big data: Apache Hadoop
- Data scientist - usually highest paid in this path
  - Similar to data analyst, but require advanced math, statistics,
    analysis skills like computer science python, Java, SQL, and machine
    learning
  - Make future predictions

## Machine Learning (ML) Engineer

- Related to big data, except using data with machines for outcomes

- Take data from data engineer and feed to machines - machines can
  perform tasks without being explicitly programmed to do a task

- Write ML algorithms, train the ML model by feeding it with data

- Overlap with data engineering with math and statistics skills

- Skills:

  - Programming: Python
  - ML learning libraries, frameworks
  - Math and statistics

## Learning Approach

- Language:

  - Python is present in most paths - python is a general purpose
    language, but each path uses it differently
    - Have libraries useful for each path

- Online course, college/university, bootcamp, self teaching

- Nana's combination was university, then work in industry and online
  self teaching

- Important is roadmap for learning to structure

- Choose entry level career and start learning
