### Checklist of Legal, Financial, and Practical Steps to Take After a Loved One Dies

- Steps to take in the first hours after a death
- Steps to take in the first days after a death
- Steps to take in the first weeks and months after a death
- Final steps to take after a death

1.  Documents to gather

    After someone you love dies, there are many matters to take care of.
    At the same time, the emotional impact of your loss may make it hard
    to concentrate on all the practical, financial, and legal steps
    you'll need to take in the near future. Having a checklist of your
    responsibilities will help you stay focused in the coming days,
    weeks, and months. It will also make it easier to divide up the
    tasks among friends and relatives. And if you are entitled to any
    benefits, working from a checklist will ensure that you get them
    without unnecessary delays.

    The following checklist will remind you of some of the most
    important things to do after a loss. If you are the executor of an
    estate, you will be responsible for many of these steps. If you
    aren't, you may find it helpful to know what's involved. Taking
    these steps will be easier if, as soon as possible, you gather
    documents that can help. You'll find these listed at the end of this
    article.

2.  Steps to take in the first hours after a death

    ► Get a legal "pronouncement" of death. A doctor or hospice nurse
    can provide one. If the person has died at home and neither a doctor
    nor hospice nurse is present, call 911. Paramedics will transport
    the body to a hospital where a doctor can pronounce the death.

    ► Arrange for any requested organ donations. You may need to act
    immediately to ensure that an organ is viable for transplant.

    ► Make a list of immediate family members and anyone else who should
    be notified right away. Call immediate family members and close
    friends. Ask them to help you notify others.

    ► Arrange for transportation of the body. Most people ask a funeral
    home or crematorium to do this.

    ► If the deceased has children or pets, plan for their immediate and
    longer-term care.

    ► Secure the property of the person who died. If he or she lived
    alone, lock doors and windows. Consider changing the locks if other
    people have keys.

    ► Contact the person's employer. Talk with his or her supervisor
    about what to tell co-workers about the death. Ask about any pay and
    benefits that may be due, including life insurance.

3.  Steps to take in the first days after a death

    ► Set up a filing system for documents related to the death. You may
    also want to create a folder on your computer for electronic
    records.

    ► Write down the name and contact information of everyone who offers
    to help. Let people know what they can do, whether you need help now
    or in the future.

    ► Arrange for a funeral or memorial service if you are choosing to
    have one. Before making the arrangements, determine whether the
    person had a prepaid burial plan to cover expenses. You may need to
    search the person's personal papers to confirm this.

    ► If the person served in the military, consult the Veterans Affairs
    Canada website (<http://www.veterans.gc.ca>) for important
    information about potential benefits – particularly if the decedent
    was killed while in service or injured while in service and died
    within 30 days. Search the website for "Death benefit."

    ► If the decedent belonged to a religious or fraternal organization,
    contact that group. As if they offer funeral or burial benefits or
    can help in other ways – for example, by providing pallbearers if
    you need them.

    ► Write an obituary or death notice for newspapers. Call newspapers
    or check their online obituaries to find out how to submit one. Or,
    ask a funeral home to prepare and submit an obituary for you.

    ► Locate the person's will or trust. You might find this in a file
    at home, in a safe deposit box, with the person's attorney or
    notary, or elsewhere.

    ► Arrange for the post office to forward mail if you can't collect
    it. This will keep uncollected mail from signaling that a home is
    empty. The mail may also make you aware of accounts and
    subscriptions that need to be cancelled, or assets and liabilities,
    including debts, that you didn't know about.

    ► Cancel any personal appointments that the person had made, such as
    doctor's visits and social engagements.

    ► Start gathering information about debts, bills, and unexpired
    service contracts. Make a list of what's owed, but don't pay the
    bills until you speak with an attorney about them. They may need to
    be paid from the money in the estate.

    ► Cancel credit cards. Call the customer service number for the card
    and cancel the card. This can help to prevent unauthorized use.

    ► If the person rented a home or lived in an apartment, notify the
    person's landlord, building management, or condo or co-op board of
    the death.

    ► Consider asking someone you trust to check on the person's home
    every day, to collect newspapers until deliveries stop, to watch for
    signs of a leaking roof or leaking pipes, and to turn lights on and
    off if they aren't on timers.

4.  Steps to take in the first weeks and months after a death

    ► Get copies of the death certificate. Ask the funeral home to
    request these and give you as many copies as you need, or get them
    from the office of vital statistics or records in your
    province/territory. You will probably need at least 10 death
    certificates to apply for benefits, file tax returns, and gain
    access to bank accounts.

    ► Talk with an attorney about how to meet any legal
    responsibilities. A lawyer can advise you on the next steps you may
    need to take, such as how to probate the estate (if necessary), how
    to follow the terms of a will, and whether you need to file a tax
    return for the estate. Be sure to talk with an attorney before you
    pay any debts, collect any life insurance, and retitle or distribute
    any assets. Any of these could have legal consequences.

    ► Keep a record of any financial transactions involving the estate,
    such as receipts for purchases, appraisals, and repairs or services
    needed to prepare a home for a sale.

    ►Cancel subscriptions and services that are no longer needed, such
    as magazines, cable TV, cell phone, Internet, and home-delivered
    meals. Cancel memberships to gyms and social or professional clubs
    and organizations.

    ► If the person was receiving government benefits, such as Canada
    Pension Plan (CPP), Old Age Security (OAS), disability, or veterans
    benefits, contact the appropriate agencies to discontinue benefits
    and to ask about survivor's benefits. You can visit the Government
    of Canada's benefits website (<http://www.canadabenefits.gc.ca>) to
    locate the appropriate agencies.

    ► Cancel any health or other insurance plans that are no longer
    necessary. You may also need to cancel auto or other insurance.

    ► Notify life insurance companies and others that may provide
    benefits. Besides life insurance, these may include accident
    insurance, mortgage insurance, or other policies.

    ► Find out about employment benefits if the person was working. Ask
    about pension, union, credit union, or other death benefits.

    ► Cancel the person's driver's license. This can help to prevent
    identity theft. Contact the motor vehicles department about the
    procedure in your province/territory. You may also need to cancel
    hunting, fishing, professional, or other licenses.

    ► Close email and social media accounts and online payment services,
    such as PayPal. Check the websites for instructions on how to do
    this. You may want to keep one social media account active for a
    period of time so that people can post tributes. You may want to
    keep the person's primary email account active for a month or two
    and monitor it for notifications from financial or other
    institutions where the person may have had accounts or other
    business.

    ► Watch out for leases or contracts with penalties for early
    termination, such as car leases. A death may not cancel these
    penalties. However, if your contract permits, you may be able to
    avoid them by transferring the lease to someone else. Talk with an
    attorney if you have questions about any contract.

5.  Final steps to take after a death

    If you are the executor of the deceased person's estate, you will
    need to take additional steps to settle the estate.

    ► Read and understand the will. If a will doesn't exist, follow the
    rules in your province/territory for distributing property in the
    absence of a will. If the deceased person had a trust, the trustee
    is charged with following the instructions in the trust.

    ► Take appropriate legal steps if anyone challenges the will.

    ► Continue to keep records of financial transactions that involve
    the deceased person until the estate is settled.

    ► Open a bank account for the estate if required.

    ► Pay debts as required by law.

    ► File any required tax returns for the estate.

    ► Distribute the remaining assets to beneficiaries.

    ► Close the estate.

    Before or after you settle the estate, you and your family may also
    want to create a permanent memorial to the person who died, such as
    planting a tree at their favourite spot or donating to a charity the
    person supported.

6.  Documents to gather

    You may need the following information and documents in addition to
    the person's will or trust:

    ► Social Insurance Number (SIN), which you can find on the person's
    Social Insurance card and on the death certificate

    ► Credit and debit card statements

    ► Savings bonds (or their numbers if electronic)

    ► Retirement plans such as pensions, RRSPs

    ► Records of financial accounts and investments, such as stocks and
    bonds

    ► Real estate leases or deeds and mortgage papers

    ► Contracts in force when the death occurred, such as car-leasing
    agreements or agreements with nursing homes or assisted living
    facilities

    ► Loan agreements (whether the deceased was the debtor or creditor)

    ► Driver's license and motor vehicle registration

    ► Federal income tax return

    ► Marriage license (if you are a surviving spouse and want to claim
    related benefits)

    ► Prenuptial or postnuptial agreements

    ► Divorce papers

    ► Birth certificates for dependent children

    ► Record of child support payments

    ► Military discharge papers (if needed to apply for survivor's
    benefits)

    ► Any other proof of or information about the assets or income of
    the person who died, such as annuities, disability benefits,
    unemployment or workers' compensation, and a list of valuable
    jewelry, art, or antiques.

### Making Funeral Arrangements

- Understanding your options
- Your rights and responsibilities
- Purchasing services at a funeral home
- Alternatives to funeral homes
- Paying for the arrangements
- Helpful resources

Making funeral arrangements is never easy. In addition to dealing with
the death of someone you love, you need to make many practical decisions
that take into account your family's emotional and financial concerns.

Funeral costs can be among the largest expenses you will ever face. It
is common for funerals to cost between \$7,000 and \$10,000—not counting
fees for such "extras" as flowers, vaults, or death notices. For
financial or other reasons, you may want to consider alternatives to the
traditional funeral arrangement, including one of the newer "green," or
"natural," burials. These alternatives are becoming more common among
people seeking simple and lower-cost arrangements. Knowing your options
can help you make the right decisions at a difficult time for you and
your family.

1.  Understanding your options

    Funeral arrangements are usually easier to make when you know the
    wishes of the person who died. The ideal time to talk about your
    preferences is when you and someone you love are both healthy and
    able to view the issues objectively. If you find it hard to bring up
    your concerns, you might ask an attorney or financial adviser to
    help by raising questions during a discussion of other matters, such
    as a will or insurance.

    Whether or not you've talked about the funeral plans in advance,
    here are some of your options:

    **A traditional funeral service**. A religious service is led by a
    member of the clergy and can be held at a house of worship, funeral
    home, or other location. At the end of the service, there can be an
    optional procession to the cemetery for a short committal service as
    the casket is put in place.

    **A memorial service**. The most common kind of memorial service
    takes place in a house of worship or a funeral home (where a formal
    viewing may also be held). Some families prefer to hold a simple
    service without the body, often at a place beloved by the person who
    died, such as a vacation or retirement home. A friend, relative, or
    clergy member may preside over this kind of gathering. No matter
    where it is held, a memorial service often includes a selection of
    the deceased's favou rite music or readings.

    **A graveside service**. Instead of a formal memorial service, some
    families choose a simple graveside or committal service with a
    closed casket. This kind of service is sometimes used when the death
    occurred elsewhere and the casket is brought to the cemetery. A
    family may also hold a private graveside service before or after a
    more formal or public memorial service.

    **Cremation**. Cremation is becoming much more common because of the
    simplicity of arrangements and lower cost (typically, \$1,000 to
    \$2,000), and sometimes because of personal preference. The National
    Funeral Directors Association (NFDA), an industry group, reports
    that the rate of cremation surpassed the rate of burial for the
    first time in 2015 and has continued to rise since then. Cremation
    does not rule out having a viewing or memorial service. Funeral
    homes usually offer rental caskets or unfinished wooden boxes to use
    for viewing before cremation. After cremation, ashes are stored in a
    modest container and returned to the family. The ashes may be kept
    in an urn or similar container in a cemetery or memorial garden that
    the family can visit. Some families choose to scatter the ashes at a
    favourite spot of the person who died.

    **A** traditional casket burial. Many people choose a casket burial
    in a cemetery. Cemeteries are run by municipalities, churches, or
    other religious groups or by private organizations. Veterans can be
    buried, if space allows, in a government cemetery. If your family
    does not have a plot or preferred cemetery, you'll need to research
    convenient cemeteries. Call the cemetery's office to ask about
    prices and available plots. Plots are normally purchased directly
    from cemeteries, and their costs are not usually included in the
    fees charged by the funeral home.

    **A "green," or "natural," burial**. For this type of burial, the
    body is prepared in an environmentally friendly way—often without
    preservatives such as formaldehyde-containing embalming fluid—and
    may be placed in a biodegradable shroud or coffin. Green burials may
    take place in some traditional cemeteries or in special nature
    preserves, often called "green cemeteries," and they are becoming
    more popular both for environmental reasons and because they may
    cost as little as \$1,000. In a 2015 survey of green burial
    cemeteries, 72.4 percent of respondents reported that demand for
    ecofriendly burials was increasing.

    **A casket**. Burial involves a casket, usually the most expensive
    item on the bill for the funeral. A casket can cost anywhere from a
    few hundred dollars for a simple box to thousands of dollars for a
    fancy coffin. Avoid sealed or "protective" coffins that are very
    expensive and often fail to preserve the body as promised. If the
    person who died asked for a simple casket, request a pine box. You
    can save on a casket by buying one at a casket retail store or
    online or by renting one if cremation is planned. Some cemeteries
    require a liner under the coffin to prevent the ground from sinking
    over time.

    **Embalming**. Embalming is an expensive procedure that preserves
    the body for an open-casket viewing. No state requires embalming as
    a matter of course, though some states require it in certain
    circumstances, such as in the case of a communicable disease, a
    delay in disposal, or the need to transport the body across state
    lines. An alternative to embalming is refrigeration or a prompt
    viewing. If no viewing is planned, embalming is not necessary.
    Another option is cosmetic restoration, which creates a lifelike
    look for viewing.

    **Body donation**. Many people want to leave their bodies to
    hospitals or medical schools for research or teaching purposes. If
    this is a possibility, check first with the institution about its
    requirements for age, embalming, transportation, and physical
    requirements. Your friend or relative will need to make an agreement
    with the medical institution and file it with his or her papers. The
    body may not be accepted at the time of death because of age,
    disease, or lack of need by the institution, so the person will need
    to make a backup arrangement.

    **Organ donation**. A growing number of people are making
    arrangements to bequeath parts of their bodies for transplant. They
    usually fill out an organ donor card and keep it in their wallet, or
    their preference may be noted on their driver's license. Organs must
    be removed promptly after death, and the donor must meet age and
    health requirements that vary depending on the organ. Be sure other
    family members know about and agree with a relative's decisions
    about organ donation to ensure that the donor's wishes will be
    honoured.

2.  Your rights and responsibilities

    When you pay for funeral services, you have certain rights and
    responsibilities. It's a good idea to:

    **Talk with your family members about their concerns**. You and your
    siblings or children may have very different ideas about the kind of
    funeral you want. If that's the case, you may be able to work out a
    compromise. For example, if you want a very simple service for a
    parent but your siblings would prefer something more elaborate, you
    might have a private graveside service just for the family and close
    friends, followed by a large memorial service open to everybody.

    **Compare prices**. Many people select a funeral home based on
    location, convenience, or family tradition. This approach often
    makes sense, especially if you have an unlimited budget. But if
    you're worried about costs, it pays to shop around for the best
    prices and service. Funeral homes (though not cemeteries) must
    disclose prices over the phone and offer you detailed price lists
    when you visit. Many funeral homes will also mail you price lists.

    **Try to visit more than one funeral home**. Speak with the staff,
    get a tour of the facilities, and ask for printed price lists of
    items such as caskets and liners. You have a right to expect clear,
    helpful, and courteous answers to your questions. If you have
    concerns, call your local Better Business Bureau or consumer
    protection agency to find out if it has received complaints about
    the funeral homes you visit.

    **Know your rights**. When purchasing funeral services, you are
    protected by the Funeral Rule, or Funeral Law, enforced by the
    Federal Trade Commission (FTC). This rule requires funeral homes to
    publish price lists, to allow you to refuse to buy items that you
    don't want (with certain exceptions), and to take other steps that
    protect people at a vulnerable time. To learn more about your
    rights, visit the FTC website or call 202-326-2222.

3.  Purchasing services at a funeral home

    Funeral arrangements are most frequently made through a funeral
    home. Funeral directors, also called morticians or undertakers,
    oversee all aspects of the funeral and burial. A funeral director
    can be a calming presence during an emotional event, but it's
    important to choose carefully. Look for someone who will take the
    time to explain your options to you without using high-pressure
    sales tactics.

    A funeral home typically can provide you with or arrange for such
    things as a casket, vault, flowers, music, death notices, embalming,
    transportation of the body, information about death benefits, rooms
    for the visitation, and a guest book and thank-you cards. If the
    deceased or family members belong to a church or other religious
    institution, the funeral director can contact the clergy there to
    see what options are available for a service. Even if there is no
    religious membership or affiliation, the funeral director can
    recommend and contact area clergy who can provide a religious
    funeral, memorial, or graveside service.

    Some families make arrangements for a luncheon following the funeral
    service for all in attendance. Often, a religious group, V.F.W., or
    other organization can provide this at a low price. The funeral
    director generally does not make these arrangements, but can give
    you contact information. A luncheon after the funeral or service can
    provide an opportunity for socializing, healing, and sharing
    memories of the deceased.

    The casket is usually the largest single expense for a funeral. Most
    traditional caskets cost about \$2,500 to \$4,500, and elaborate
    coffins can cost much more than that. Here are some things to know
    before you make a decision:

    **You can choose from many styles and prices**. Although wood is the
    most traditional material, caskets also come in metal, plastic, and
    fiberglass.

    **You can buy caskets at other places besides a funeral home**.
    Caskets are available from many cemeteries and online. By law, a
    funeral home cannot refuse to handle a casket that you bought
    elsewhere or charge you an extra fee for the service.

    **You may not need a casket**. You will not have to buy a casket if
    the person who died has chosen cremation or immediate burial or is
    donating his or her body to science.

4.  Alternatives to funeral homes

    If you want a simple service that avoids many of the usual funeral
    home costs, you may want to look into a memorial society or a
    direct-burial firm.

    **Memorial societies**. These are groups that negotiate contracts
    with local mortuaries for low-cost services. A small fee provides
    lifetime membership and access to the legal and other information
    needed to have a no-frills burial or cremation. Society members
    prefer to avoid embalming, make-up, open-casket viewing, and
    expensive coffins. Many members have memorial services in a
    religious setting. To find a society, search the Internet for
    "Memorial Society" or "Memorial Association."

    **Direct burial**. Also called "direct disposal," direct burial is a
    one-price service for the removal of the body and burial or
    cremation. Firms that specialize in direct disposal collect the body
    from the place of death and transport it to the chosen cemetery or
    crematorium. This way, they eliminate many of the services provided
    by a funeral home. This low-cost alternative is often used by
    families that prefer a memorial service without a viewing or casket.
    If you can't find a firm that offers direct burial, you can request
    that your funeral home provide direct burial or minimal service.

    If you use one of these alternatives, be sure to plan a memorial
    service that will meet the emotional needs of your family, including
    younger members. Seeing a casket or attending a visitation may help
    children or teenagers accept the finality of death, so if you
    dispense with these traditions, plan an appropriate way for young
    mourners to say goodbye to someone they loved. They might light
    candles, share their reminiscences, or pay special tribute at a
    memorial service.

5.  Paying for the arrangements

    There are many ways to pay for a funeral. You may decide to put
    money in a special account, pay the costs out of the estate, or buy
    a prepaid package. Here are some of the pros and cons:

    Paying at the time of the funeral. If you choose to do this, costs
    can be taken out of the estate or paid directly by you or other
    relatives. You may want to set up a savings or investment account
    earmarked for the expense. Setting up an irrevocable, or
    non-revocable, account or trust will protect the money if someone
    enters a nursing home. In this way, you earn all the interest, you
    can't lose the money by cancellation of a plan, and the funds will
    be available when needed.

    Paying through a commercial prepayment plan. Many funeral homes
    offer prepaid funeral plans that cover the cost of a casket,
    transportation of the body, the services of a funeral director, and
    other related expenses. If you are prepaying, be sure your agreement
    clearly states the cost of each item and a description of each item
    or service you will receive. The agreement should also list any
    restrictions, including geographic limitations. Some prepaid
    funerals are guaranteed, meaning that your family will not have to
    pay additional money to the provider at the time of death. Avoid
    plans that are nonrefundable, which can leave you without coverage
    if unforeseen circumstances occur. It's also a good idea to have an
    attorney or accountant read the prepayment contract, which should
    answer these questions:

    - What goods and services are included?
    - What kind of account will be used to fund the funeral?
    - What happens to the interest income?
    - Are my payments guaranteed to cover all desired expenses?
    - Can I change my mind about the use of the funds?
    - What penalties will I have to pay if I miss an installment
      payment?
    - If I move, can the plan be transferred at no additional cost?
    - What happens in the case of a shortfall or excess of money in the
      account?
    - If you haven't made advance payment arrangements and the estate
      cannot pay for the funeral, you - may want to consider signing any
      Social Security or death benefits over to the funeral director.

### Selecting or Serving as an Executor of an Estate

- Duties and responsibilities of the executor
- Choosing an executor
- Serving as an executor

The executor of an estate is the person nominated in a will or appointed
by a judge to manage and distribute the property of a person who has
died. Sometimes executors are referred to as "personal representatives"
or "administrators."

Although laws vary from province to province or territory, in general,
executors must be over the age of 18, must be mentally competent, and
must have no felony convictions on their record. In addition, provincial
and or territorial laws may impose conditions on out-of-province or
territory executors, such as requiring that they be related to the
deceased. The executor may be one of the heirs or beneficiaries of the
estate. (Heirs are people who inherit money or other assets from an
estate if someone dies without a will. Beneficiaries are people who
inherit because they are named in a will.) Many people choose a
beneficiary to be the executor because they believe that someone with a
personal stake may be most conscientious in carrying out their wishes
and managing the affairs of the estate.

1.  Duties and responsibilities of the executor

    The duties of the executor begin with taking inventory of all of the
    estate's assets. To do this, he or she will need to determine what
    assets make up the estate. An executor typically identifies the
    assets partly by looking at chequebooks, bank statements, personal
    mail, insurance policies, and other important papers. Locating the
    assets may also involve checking computer files or other electronic
    records and tracking down any required passwords and personal
    identification numbers (PINs).

    From there, the executor must determine whether the probate court
    will need to be involved in the distribution of the estate. Each
    province or territory has its own laws that determine when a will or
    an estate must be filed with the probate court. Typically, this
    decision is based on the value of the estate and what kinds of
    assets the decedent possessed. The executor can contact the local
    clerk of the court or an attorney to find out whether the will or
    estate needs to be probated.

    The executor commonly performs the following tasks:

    **Compile a list of the assets and debts of the estate.**

    **File the will and other legal documents with the probate court.**
    The executor may be able to do this without a lawyer, depending on
    the complexity of the estate and on the legal process in the
    province or territory. The executor can contact the clerk of the
    probate court to find out if the court offers any help in filing the
    paperwork (such as standard forms that can serve as a petition).

    **If the will is not self-proving**, the executor may need to find
    witnesses to the will and have them sign a statement, under oath,
    about the validity of their original signatures. A self-proving will
    is one that includes, as attachments, sworn, notarized statements by
    the witnesses.

    **Notify creditors or other interested parties of the death.**

    **Notify heirs and beneficiaries.**

    **Secure the home of the person who died so that people can't take
    what they aren't entitled to.**

    **Pay debts from the value of the estate.** Certain types of debts
    have priority over others under the law, and the law varies by
    province or territory. If the person who has died owes money to the
    government or owes money for child support, alimony, a student loan,
    or for property that was held as a security interest (such as a home
    mortgage or an automobile loan), the executor should consult with an
    attorney before paying other debts or distributing assets.

    **Manage the assets of the estate.** This may include deciding
    whether to sell property, paying bills and expenses related to
    maintenance of the property, and setting up a bank account for the
    estate.

    **Distribute or supervise the distribution of any assets that remain
    after all debts have been paid.**

    **Prepare and file tax returns.** This includes making any payments
    due, and, for large estates, filing any applicable state and federal
    inheritance or estate tax returns along with any payments due.
    Before filing, consult an accountant to find out what expenses (for
    example, funeral expenses and attorney and accountant fees) may be
    deductible.

    **Prepare an accounting of the estate, a summary of everything the
    executor has done.**

2.  Choosing an executor

    If you are writing a will, it's important to name an executor.
    Otherwise, a judge will appoint someone, typically a relative of the
    decedent. If there's someone you think would be best suited to the
    task, be sure to name your choice in your will.

    Choose someone you trust, but don't let your emotions alone guide
    you. Look for someone who is detail-oriented, able to organize and
    manage complicated information, and good at communicating with
    others. Also make sure that the person you choose is eligible under
    state law to serve as your executor.

    Talk with the person you choose to be your executor to make sure he
    or she is willing to take on this task. And once you've gotten the
    person's OK, make your executor's job easier by letting him or her
    know where to find necessary documents, starting with your will.

3.  Serving as an executor

    If you are serving as an executor, you have the right to hire any
    help that you reasonably need to fulfill your responsibilities, such
    as a probate lawyer, a financial consultant, or an accountant. The
    fees for these services can be paid out of the estate's assets. You
    also have the right to be reimbursed out of the value of the estate
    for reasonable expenses, such as the cost of long-distance phone
    calls or travel required by your duties as an executor.

    You might also consider obtaining a bond, a form of insurance that
    would compensate the estate for any losses caused by fraud,
    embezzlement, or negligence. A bond protects you against lawsuits
    filed by disgruntled beneficiaries. It remains in place until the
    estate is settled and closed.

    Executors are also entitled to a fee for their services. The fee is
    set by provincial or territorial law or can be established in the
    will. In reality, executors often waive the fee, especially if they
    inherit a portion of the estate.

    You can find more information on the rights and responsibilities of
    an executor in /The Executor's Guide: Settling a Loved One's Estate
    or Trust /(7th edition), by attorney Mary Randolph.

    It's an honour to be named as an executor, but be aware that it's
    also a responsibility that may turn out to be a job that lasts for
    many months. Be sure to gather all the assistance and documentation
    you need, both to protect yourself and to best pay your respects to
    the person who entrusted you with this task.

### Taking Care of Forms, Finances, and Paperwork After a Death: What documents will you need?

*The emotional impact of a death often makes it hard to concentrate on
all the paperwork you have to do after someone close to you has died.
You can avoid becoming overwhelmed by the details if you understand
which documents you will need following a death and where to get help
with them. Keeping careful track of the paperwork can also help to
ensure that if you are entitled to any benefits, you will receive them
without unnecessary delays.*

➤ This is the first in a five-part series of articles on taking care of
forms, finances, and paperwork after a death.

1.  What documents will you need?

    Settling the affairs of someone who has died begins with gathering
    certain documents. You may find some of these in a safe deposit box
    or in the paper or computer files of the person who died. If you
    can't find what you need, check with a family attorney or financial
    adviser. You may need to locate:

    **Death certificates**. You will probably need several copies of the
    death certificate, for example to apply for survivor benefits, make
    a life insurance claim, sell the deceased's property, and gain
    access to bank accounts. You can get copies from the vital
    statistics office of the province or territory where the death
    occurred. A death certificate may cost \$30 or more, and the price
    may vary depending on whether you order online (typically less
    expensive) or by mail or in person.

    **Insurance policies**. If you can't find copies of insurance
    policies, you can get them from the deceased's insurance agent or
    broker. You can also contact the insurance company directly to
    request copies.

    **Social Insurance Numbers (SINs)** for the person who died, the
    spouse, and any dependent children. If you don't know the SIN of the
    person who died, the executor of the estate can request it from
    Service Canada. Another way to find the SIN is to get a copy of a
    recent tax return. The SIN is on the first page of the return.

    **A copy of the will**. You may find the will with the family
    attorney, in a safe deposit box, or among personal belongings. You
    might need to check the files of an attorney who was consulted in a
    place where the person used to live. Many people make more than one
    will during a lifetime, altering their bequests as their
    circumstances change, so be sure you have the most current will.

    **Birth certificates for dependent children**. It's a good idea to
    have or get these. Birth certificates can be obtained from the Vital
    Statistics Office or website of the Province where the
    child/children are born. Typically need a notarized request form
    from Vital Statistics and payment of a fee.

    **A list of all property and other assets**, such as homes, cars,
    boats, investments, financial accounts, pension funds, insurance
    policies, and personal property. The list should note how the
    property is titled (the exact name of the official owner).

    **The most recent federal and provincial income tax returns filed by
    the person who died**. If the returns were prepared by a
    professional, such as an attorney or a tax accountant, the tax
    preparer will probably have copies of the tax returns. If the
    deceased person prepared the returns using software, look on his or
    her computer. Contact the software vendor if you need assistance
    getting access to the records.

    **Marriage certificate**. A surviving spouse will need a marriage
    certificate to apply for OAS, Canada Pension Plan, and other
    benefits. A copy of the marriage certificate can be obtained from
    the vital statistics office or website of the province where the
    marriage took place.

    **Military service files**. To obtain military service records,
    visit the Government of Canada site and make a [request for military
    service
    files](https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/transparency/atippr/Pages/Access-information-military-files.aspx).
    Contact 1-866-578-7777 for more information

    **A credit report of the person who died**. A credit report can help
    to identify creditors of the person who died. Creditors are usually
    paid out of the assets of the estate of the decedent. Credit reports
    from the two major credit-reporting bureaus (Equifax Canada, and
    TransUnion Canada) can be obtained by mail. Instructions can be
    found at the credit-reporting bureaus' websites.

    **A resume**. A written summary of a career can help to ensure the
    accuracy of newspaper death notices or tributes in other places,
    such as club or company newsletters. It may also provide leads to
    former employers who may have pensions or death benefits in place
    for the deceased person.

    You may also need to find **computer, phone, and website passwords
    and personal identification numbers (PINs)** to gain access to
    records that relate to the estate.
