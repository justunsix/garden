### Example assessment based on Screening for Colorectal Cancer

From [My CancerIQ \| Learn Your Risk](https://www.mycanceriq.ca)

- Based on family history, there is average risk of developing
  colorectal cancer.
- You should get screened, see [Screening for Colorectal Cancer \|
  Cancer Care
  Ontario](https://www.cancercareontario.ca/en/types-of-cancer/colorectal/screening).
  For example, Fecal immunochemical test (FIT) / Fecal Occult Blood Test
  (FOBT) every two years between the ages of 50 to 74.

If you have previously had a colonoscopy with clear results during
recommended screen times, next screening can be farther out.

Here are symptoms to watch out for:

- Unexplained changes in bowel patterns
- Rectal bleeding
- Unexplained weight loss
- Urgent need to empty bowel
- Unexplained stool incontinence (anal leakage)

If you experience any of these symptoms, it's important that you discuss
them with your doctor or nurse practitioner.
