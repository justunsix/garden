Source: My person notes and thoughts on [How to Future-Proof Your
Software Engineering Career for the Age of AGI -
victoria.dev](https://victoria.dev/how-to-future-proof-your-software-engineering-career-for-the-age-of-agi/)

Article describes concepts and learning to prepare for a career in
artificial intelligence, including artificial general intelligence (AGI)
in 2025. It suggests places to find learning

## Why prepare for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)?

- AGI can do any task a human can do with their brain, learn and adapt,
  and improve itself
- For people working on AGI, engineers can create systems that can do
  tasks by themselves and mean new ways of system development
- AGI combined with hardware can do any tasks a human does by itself and
  learn and improve over time

Below are areas to look at for preparing yourself

## Machine Learning and Deep Learning

- Allow systems to learn from data, see patterns and make decisions
- Concept help you know how to create models that handle unstructured
  data and make decisions

### Topics

- Supervised learning
- Reinforcement learning, agents
- Unsupervised learning - systems find hidden patterns in data without
  specific guidance
- Neural networks
- Deep learning

### How to learn

- Courses like at freeCodeCamp, Coursera, edX, or Udacity
- Projects:
  - Build machine learning models and experiment with different types of
    data
  - [Kaggle Competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions)

1.  Examples

    - [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster \| Kaggle
      Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)
    - [Search Machine Learning -
      freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.md/news/search/?query=machine%20learning)

## AI Integration and Engineering

- Integrate software and hardware with AI
- Might be APIs, platforms

### How to learn

- Work on AI components in software and hardware
- Understand cloud AI services like AWS SageMaker or Google AI Platform
- Projects: Integrate applications with AI like chatbots, predictive
  analytics

## Ethics and AI Governance

- Using AGI like any general purpose tools will require ethics and
  governance with policy and legal requirements

### Topics

- Accountability
- Transparency
- Statistics
- Policy

### How to learn

- Read about policy at organizationsl and government
- Learn social sciences

## Human Computer Interaction (HCI)

### How to learn
