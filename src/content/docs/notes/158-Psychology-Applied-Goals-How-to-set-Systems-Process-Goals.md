title: How to Set Systems, Process Goals
---

Source: My notes from [How to Set Systems Instead of Goals, system that
will change your life - Alexis Kingsley](https://youtu.be/f9IpkxXENkw)

- Have your end in mind - purpose, dreams
- Goal like Mountain of your dreams
  - Research support larger goal, more likely to achieve it
  - To climb mountain, start with habit, make a plan, implement systems
- Goal like hill goal - smaller goal

- Fill in: My purpose is to pursue <u>\_</u> and feel <u>\_</u> helping
  others feel the same.

  - Fill in things that cause you anger, heartbreak, and envy.
  - Find commonality between those things

## Exercise: Life dreams

  - What do you do, relationships, work, food, how do you treat people,
    body feel, home

    excel in long term (10+ years) goal progression

- Review/Write 10 dreams everyday and circle/write the one you are
  pursuing currently
  - Choose most significant goal that will help others
- Quarterly dreams:
  - By the end of quarter 1, I will be a <u><u>who</u></u>, with a
    <u><u>what</u></u> by <u><u>how</u></u> <u><u>how many</u></u>
    because <u><u>why</u></u>
    - Who do you want to be?
    - What do you want to have (an outcome that you may not have full
      control)?
    - How are you going to do it?
      - Verbs, actions
    - How many / how often?
      - Quantity / frequency
    - Why do you want to do it? - purpose
  - Make more specific goals based on how and how many using time
    periods (week, days, hours)
    - Chunk to daily goals
    - "5 to strive system"
      - 5 days with specific goals
      - Just 5 minutes
      - Acknowledge your estimates and progress may not meet goals at
        first
