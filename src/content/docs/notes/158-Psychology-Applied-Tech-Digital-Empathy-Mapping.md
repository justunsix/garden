title: Digital Empathy Mapping
---

Source: My personal notes from "Empathy Mapping and Digital
Transformation" led by Cynthia Joseph

Digital transformation: process of using digital technology and its
abilities to create a new business model. It follows Plan, Do, Check,
Act with continuous improvement, Design Thinking.

Empathize:

- Part 1 of design thinking to understand the problem by talking to
  people and users
- Gather user information:
  - needs and organize them (priority, scope)
  - group similar users

## Empathy Map

- Use map when starting digital transformation

- Identify 5 users, create user groups to build personas

- How to map?

  - Observation, UI wireframe
  - Interviews
  - Surveys
  - Map using a template depending on solution
  - Record senses of users: see, say, hear, feel, smell
  - Empathizing on: who are we empathizing with, what they
    do/see/say/hear, user's pains/gains

## Activity

Empathy map for users of public pools - what would they want, their
motivations, dreams, fears
