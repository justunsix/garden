If you have any pre-existing medical conditions that could put you at
risk of an injury, please refrain from trying it out. Stay home, stay
safe, stay fit.

Repeat the routine 3 times over, with increasing intensities:

- MILD – Warm-up pace
- INTENSE – Speed things up, without going overboard
- INSANE – AS FAST AS YOU CAN Always choose form over speed.

If you start losing composure and precision in your movements, then it's
time to take a break. Have a glass of water next to you for hydration,
and a towel for the planks.

- JUMPING JACKS – 30 seconds Jump up and down, closing and opening your
  legs repeatedly. Your arms lift when you open your legs and come back
  down when you close them. Keep the arms straight, bend the knees
  slightly to land softly. SQUATS – 30 seconds Open your legs, not too
  wide. Bend your knees while pushing the butt back. Keep the back
  straight, and the knees behind the toes.

- PLANK SIDE-CRUNCHES – 30 seconds Get into elbow-plank position. Lift
  and bring your right leg to your right side, at the hip level, as if
  you wanted to bring your knee to your elbow. Bring it back down and
  alternate the with the left leg repeatedly.

- MOUNTAIN CLIMBERS – 30 seconds Get into the full plank position, with
  the arms straight. Bring your right leg to your right elbow, squeezing
  the abs to keep the feet from touching the ground. Then switch sides -
  left knee goes to the left elbow – and repeat.

- HEISMAN – 30 seconds Open your legs, bend the knees and lean slightly
  forward. From there, lift your legs right and left, jumping from side
  to side. Keep the abdominal belt tight, bend the knees to land.

- HIGH KNEES – 30 seconds Keeping the back straight, alternate lifting
  your knees to hip-level. Do not lean back, lift with your abs, use
  your arms for stability.

- BUTT KICKS – 30 seconds Run in the same spot, lifting your heels
  further back as if you wanted them to hit your butt. Keep the back
  straight, lean slightly forward.

- PUSH-UPS – 30 seconds Get into full plank position. Place your hands
  below your chest, at a distance slightly wider than your shoulders'
  width. Then bring your chest down, 2-3 centimetres above ground, and
  back up. If you are new to push-ups, we recommend you start on your
  knees.

- SKI JUMPS - 30 seconds Bring the feet together. Bend your knees, push
  your butt back. From there, jump side to side, as if skiing down a
  slope. Keep facing forward at all time, do not twist. Jump from the
  bottom, use your arms for stability and impulsion.

Stretch for 1 minute and 30 seconds after completing the routine the
third time. Focus on your legs and abdominal muscles.
