## Use Case

Azure DevOps is appropriate for teams needing tools and a place to store
and organize:

- Track and manage team/project work - can use agile methodology
- Continually build, test, and deploy - supports various languages and
  deployments to cloud and on premise
- Manage code - store in git repositories, code scanning
- Test planning and management - manual, user acceptance, automated, and
  ad hoc testing; traceability to user stories and work
- Documentation
- Dependency management, for example NuGet, npm, Python, Maven, Cargo,
  and Universal Packages

team name and child components

Backlog item

- Creation
- List of stuff that needs to be done
- Moving item to approved by product owner for work

Infrastructure team use case:

- Epic, feature, Product Backlog Item, Task
- Hierarchy: epic \> features \> product backlog items
- Epic and features should be readable by business users
- Items could be unassigned, though lowest level items should be
  assigned. Assigned could just mean who is the contact or managing it
