## How to use PlantUML in Emacs

- Use a code block like the following and a results block like that
  below will be automatically generated.
- Use `M-x plantuml-download-jar` to download it to
  `~/.config/emacs/plantuml/plantuml.jar`. Make sure the jar is copied
  to that location
- Use `plantuml-mode` on PlantUML files or highlight the PlantUML in a
  file like org-mode and `plantuml-preview` to generate diagrams
- In git, png files starting with `plantuml` will be ignored.
- Use `:exports both` in plantuml code block header to export both code
  and results during export

``` plantuml

Alice -> Bob: test

```
