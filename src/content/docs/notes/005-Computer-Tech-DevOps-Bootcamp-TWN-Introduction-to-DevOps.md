## Software Development Life Cycle

- Software development has many roles: Plan \> Implement \> Test \>
  Deploy \> Maintain - for complete software development process:
  - Programming
    - Developers, maybe teams per feature, different languages, create
      and fix features
  - Testing
    - Developers, testers, test new features, verify old functionality,
      automated tests
  - Release of Software
    - Build, deploy on servers, upgrade existing software
  - Operations
    - Run software in production
- People tend to know their own area. Traditional Development vs
  Operations
  - Need releases, no downtime
- DevOps engineers must know each concept

## Waterfall vs. Agile

- Waterfall - plan everything before as requirements \> development \>
  testing \> fixes \> operations, prepare deployment
  - Each step take months / years
  - Ineffective process, room for miscommunication
  - Slow requirements and little feedback
- Agile
  - Dev-test in cycles delivering features, immediate feedback
  - Faster development and deployment
  - Frameworks:
    - Scrum
    - Kanban
  - Continuous delivery and deployment/integration
  - DevOps implements many practices of agile
