## The Unwarping Module

### Changing Warped Thoughts

Changing Warped Thoughts by Other Methods, Learning to Identify Personal
Vulnerabilities, More Help with Self-Esteem Including Getting Out.

### What you think is what you feel

Remember WUTIWUF – What you think is what you feel?

**Events** lead to \>\>\> **Thoughts** which lead to \>\>\> **Feelings**
which lead to \>\>\> **Behaviours**.

When events happen in life, we develop thoughts and feelings about those
events, which affect our behaviour.

Remember the 10 types of warped thinking – for example, all or none
thinking, magnification?

### Contesting Warped Thinking

Remember the set of questions used to contest each of these types of
warped thinking?

Remember the seven areas of personal vulnerability? Check your workbook
to see whether your vulnerabilities were any of the following

- The **need for approval** (you are very sensitive to criticism and the
  good opinions of others, you feel the need to keep others happy).

- The **need to be loved** (you feel happiest when others approve and
  love you, without it you feel worthless and rejected, if someone you
  like doesn't like you, you feel unlovable).

- The **need to succeed** (you feel you must be outstanding in one area
  at least, you feel inferior and a failure if you do not succeed).

- The **need to be perfect** (if it can't be done excellently, then
  there is no point in doing it at all, falling short of perfection is
  pathetic and B (even C) grade, making a mistake is devastating.

- The **sense of feeling deserving** (if you can't get what you are
  entitled to, then it's not fair, it's unjust, unreasonable and
  frustrating; if you are kind and thoughtful then others should be kind
  back).

- The **sense of being able to influence all things** (if something
  happens, somebody gets upset then it is your fault and you are
  responsible).

- The **sense that happiness is contingent upon external things** (you
  feel you have no control over your emotions, your feelings, that
  happiness is dependent on external factors).

## Be Nice to Yourself

Remember the start to self-esteem improvement, by being nice to yourself
and being your own best friend.

The first exercise to improve self-esteem involves trying to treat
yourself the way that you would a friend.

- Every day in the next week spend 10 minutes doing something that you
  like to do. This means indulging yourself, spending time alone, if you
  like doing that, with music, etc.

- Spend 5 minutes everyday being as nice to yourself as you would to a
  friend who has problems with their self-esteem.  
  For example, if you react badly to a situation, don't say to yourself
  "you worthless worm", say "it's pretty normal to react that way, you
  are being hard on yourself. I think you handled the situation as best
  you could", etc.

**Keep a diary of these interactions** – so that you know that you did
the exercise, and you develop ideas about how this exercise is working
for you.
