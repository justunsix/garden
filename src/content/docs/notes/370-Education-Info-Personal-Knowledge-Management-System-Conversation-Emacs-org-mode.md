## Meeting management

- Auto generate meeting summaries with actions, convert to org-mode
  files and tagged tasks
- Regularly schedule review of tasks
- Technology:
  - Firefly AI for meeting notes and actions
  - org-mode, org-review, org-roam templates for task management,
    filters, and schedules

## Habits

- Atomic habits: a point is behaviour oriented thinking, habit/system
  oriented thinking will be more successful than goal oriented thinking
  in long term. Small incremental work, even 1-5 minutes habit builds
  success.
- For example, instead of goal to clean office, make habit to clean some
  clutter each time you take a break
- In summary, form habits to achieve goals
  - Be consistent and be ok with occasionally not doing a habit

## Task Views

Reports could be:

- Scheduled tasks for a date like today
- High priority / need to be done task
- Tasks without planning date
- Tasks by project

Searches could be using org-ql, a search tool for org-mode

Can use checkers to ensure data is correct like:

- org-lint
- Custom linters with personal rules
