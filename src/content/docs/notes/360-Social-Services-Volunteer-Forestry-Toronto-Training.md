2021-09-02 by Mark Peck from Royal Ontario Museum

- Food for hawks: rock pigeon, morning doves, …

- Birds of prey nesting and presence is rising and migration into
  Ontario
- Hawk migration will be in September. They like going around the lake.
  [Great Great Lakes
  Hawkwatch](https://www.hmana.org/great-great-lakes-hawkwatch/) -
  volunteers and hawk watchers to watch migration pathes
  - Hawk Migration Association of North America:
    - Hawk Hill, High Park— Toronto Hawk watching - September and
      October
    - Cranberry Marsh Hawk Watch — Whitby Halls Road
    - Niagara Peninsula Hawk Watch - Beamer Memorial Conservation Area

### Sounds that birds make

- [Audobon app](https://www.audubon.org/app)
- [Sibley Birds of North America
  app](https://www.sibleyguides.com/about/the-sibley-eguide-to-birds-app/)
- Cornell University has a site with all [sounds of birds of North
  America](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/search), example [Red
  Tailed Hawk](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/red-tailed_hawk)

### Red-tailed Hawk

<figcaption>Red-tailed Hawk front - white and a band</figcaption>
</figure>

- Common in Ontario
- Migrate to Americas and far south to South America

### How to recognize?

- Look for patagium on wing
- Tail might be red or not in young hawks

### Nests

- Hawks build nests. Note vs owls who do not build nests and take over
  nests
- Nest in trees. Can nest in human built architecture: electrical lines,
  tall lights at Toronto's Varsity Stadium, air conditioner at
  University of Toronto

### Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas

[View atlas](https://www.birdsontario.org/)

- Professionals and volunteers collect bird breeding evidence
- This version will be the 3rd atlas created
- Looking for volunteers
- Used by all levels of government, conversation people, bird hobbyists

### Cooper's Hawk

25th most common bird going to bird feeders. It goes to find prey at
feeders.

![](../media/Volunteer-Foresty-2021-09-02-19-19-19.png)

In Toronto, common with red tailed hawk nesting areas

How to identify?

- Builds stick nest, usually on deciduous trees. Native habitat were
  deep woods
- Likes cemeteries, parks, open forest areas
- Can be used to humans
- "Crow sized"

- Has a distinct sound

### American Kestrel (not a hawk)

<figure>

<figcaption>kestrel and in tree hole nest</figcaption>
</figure>

- Adapted to human architecture
- Historically, widespread in Southern Ontario, now not nesting much in
  Toronto. May be due to loss of food sources

### Broad-winged hawk

- Half size of red-tail
- Common in central Ontario. Not currently known nest in Toronto, but
  may come to city

- Build large nest, usually top of tree
- Like shallow water and feed on fish
- If humans build platforms, osprey may like it for nests

## Getting to Know Grasses

2021-08-05: Introduction to Grass Identification

Presented by: Natasha Gonsalves, Flora Biologist

### Challenges with Grass Identification (ID)

- 5 largest plant family (e.g. rice, corn, wheat)
- Lack showy flowers
- Flowering plants require a hand lens

### What is needed to ID grass?

1.  Hand lens: x10 standard
2.  Ruler for measurement
3.  ID guides
4.  Understand terminology
5.  Positive mindset :-) It will be difficult.

### What is a grass?

- Monocots
- Leaves with parallel veins
- Graminoid — herbaceous or non-woody plant With elongated stems and
  blade-like leaves
- Graminoids include:
  - Poaceae (true grasses)
  - Cyperaceae (sedges)
  - Juncaceae (rushes)

### Distinguish a grass from a grass-like plant

Leaves:

- Two-ranked, alternate up the stem

Stems:

- Round and hollow in cross-section, some could be flat, but most are
  round and hollow
- Nodes present (growing points)

### Sedges (grass like)

Leaves:

- Mainly occur towards base of plant
- Three-ranked (rows of 3)

Stems:

- "have edges"
- NOT jointed or hollow

### Rushes (grass like)

Leaves:

- Few to none
- Blades tend to be narrow and tubular
- **No ligules**

Stems:

- Round
- NOT jointed
- Solid

### How and when grasses grow

### Life cycles

Annual:

- Germinate, flower, set seed and die in a single year
- Spread via seeds only (No stolons or rhizomes)

Ways to tell:

- Entire plant straw-like after flowering
- Only new growth visible
- Shallow roots systems so easily pulled
- Plants tend to have a compact appearance

Perennial:

- Germinate, flower, set seed and die over several years
- Spreads via seeds, rhizomes and/or stolons

Ways to tell:

- Old remains of previous year usually present
- More established root systems, harder to pull
- Older plants tend to have a carpeted appearance

### Growth habit

- Bunch - see clumps, clusters (e.g. tall fescue)
- Rhizomatous - grow outwards, not clumps, spread out, underground
  growth (e.g. smooth brome)
- Stoloniferous - grow outwards, over ground growth (e.g. creeping bent
  grass)

Can grow in cool season - flower in spring

Warm/late season - flower in summer to early fall, deeper system

### Anatomy of a grass

<figure>
<img src="../media/Volunteer-Foresty-2021-08-05-13-16-59.png" />
<figcaption>grass parts shared with all grasses</figcaption>
</figure>

- Culm - always round/flat, main stem
- Leaves - growth attached to culm and attached at nodes
  - Sheath - overlaps culm and can be open or closed
  - Blade - flat part

<figure>
<img src="../media/Volunteer-Foresty-2021-08-05-13-19-20.png" />
<figcaption>leaf sheath and blade</figcaption>
</figure>

- Collar - where leaf and culm meet
- Ligules - thin membrane, where sheath and blade meet, aka "rain guard"

<figure>
<img src="../media/Volunteer-Foresty-2021-08-05-13-24-15.png" />
<figcaption>ligule - membrane / not hairy</figcaption>
</figure>

- Auricles - appendages that extend from sheath (not always present)

<figure>
<img src="../media/Volunteer-Foresty-2021-08-05-13-22-57.png" />
<figcaption>auricles</figcaption>
</figure>

### Flowers

- Wind pollinated
- Reduced and modified compared to "flowers"
- Spinklet - can have 1 or more florets. Florets have protected flowers
  in glumes (aka scales
- Awns are bristle like features on glumes, not all grasses have them

<figure>
<img src="../media/Volunteer-Foresty-2021-08-05-13-28-22.png" />
<figcaption>spinklet with multiple florets and glumes push to bottom of
spinklet</figcaption>
</figure>

- Inflorescence - collection of spikelets, types:
  - Spike - unbranched, attached to stems
  - Raceme - tight branch, spikelets attached to short stalks, then
    attached to stems
  - Panicle - like racemes, except longer stalks

### Questions

What evergreen grasses are there?

- There are some

How bad for a wet ecosystem is Reed Canary Grass compared to Phragmites?

- Any non-native / invasive grasses would be problems as they push out
  other species.

What are the most common grasses wild and human grown in Toronto?

- Wild rice
- Cultivated - Lawn grass, nurseries growing native grass (e.g. prairie
  grass)

What grasses to plant in urban areas?

- Depends on soil conditions.
- Hearty species are Little Bluestem, Big Bluestem (clumping),
  Switchgrass, Virginia Rye, Riverbank Rye. All are visually appealing
  and easy to maintain.

Recommended grass ID books?

- Field Guide to Wisconsin Grasses, Michigan flora, Grasses of the north
  east - much overlap between Ontario

### Field guides and making your own collection

- Book: Insects: Their Natural History and Diversity - Stephen A.
  Marshall
- Bug Guide - online for North America
- iNaturalist - social media insect site

Collection:

- Atelier Jean Paquet Inc.
- BioQuip
- In a government controlled area or private area, you need permission
- In a municipal, public area, bylaw restricts collection of wildlife

### Questions

Are there insects in Canada used for medicine or other interesting uses?

- Venoms from wasps and others could be used
- Insects as food for protein, e.g. crickets
- Fly larvae to break down waste
- Insects could be used to control other insects

Any things that eat ticks?

No known insects actively seek them out, though animals (possums) do.

Ticks are present usually in tall grass and present in Toronto. Toronto
Public Health sweeps for ticks, black legged ticks.
