## Tip for all Office Programs - Bold and Regular List Numbering

Source: June M at work

To prevent numbered list numbers from inheriting bold formatting from
the first word, insert a zero-width space between the number and the
text. This invisible character allows you to format the number
independently while maintaining the bolding of the text.

- Insert a zero-width space: Go to the "Insert" tab, click "Symbol," and
  choose "More Symbols".
- Select the correct character: In the "Font" dropdown, select "(normal
  text)" or a similar option.
- Enter the character code: In the "Character code" box, type "200B" and
  click "Insert". This will insert a zero-width space.
- Apply formatting: Select the number and the zero-width space, and use
  the "Home" tab to apply desired formatting (e.g., font, size).
- Bold the first word: Select the first word of the text and apply the
  bold format.

By using a zero-width space, you can separate numbering from the text,
allowing for independent formatting.
