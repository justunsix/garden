re-center yourself or improve concentration.

Four Steps to Master Box Breathing

- Step 1: Breathe in counting to four slowly. Feel the air enter your
  lungs.
- Step 2: Hold your breath for 4 seconds. Try to avoid inhaling or
  exhaling for 4 seconds.
- Step 3: Slowly exhale through your mouth for 4 seconds
- Step 4: Repeat steps 1 to 3 until you feel re-centered.

Repeat this exercise as many times as you can. 30 seconds of deep
breathing will help you feel more relaxed and in control.
