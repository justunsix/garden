1.  Technology interruptions break our hours into confetti:
    1.  Affects leisure, breaks "free" time into hard to use confetti
        (smaller pieces of time).
    2.  Takes time to cognitively recover from shifting our minds from
        the present to a stress-inducing activity.
2.  We focus too much on money:
    1.  Prioritizing making more money over having free time makes you
        feel worse later.
    2.  Money does not equal joy
3.  We undervalue time:
    1.  You need to know the value of a time spent in quantities like
        money to make informed decisions
4.  Busyness as status symbol:
    1.  Busyness is seen as important and rewarded at work, but leads to
        an unhappy and unhealthy life.
5.  Idleness aversion:
    1.  Many people do not know how to relax and feel stressed about
        leisure time.
    2.  Idleness has been shown to be a valuable form of leisure and can
        increase time affluence.
6.  We think we have more time tomorrow than we actually do
    1.  We overcommit to things without understanding their time
        commitment and value busyness.
    2.  Statistically, the best predictor of how busy we are going to be
        next week is how busy we are right now.
