## Marine Radio Safety

## Cellular Telephone Service

### Dial \*16 for Marine Emergency Service

The Canadian Coast Guard, in cooperation with the cellular carriers,
provides a marine emergency service for cellular telephone subscribers.

### Coverage

This service is currently available in areas of the Great Lakes and the
St. Lawrence Seaway having cellular coverage.

### Contacting the Coast Guard

Use of a marine radio is the most efficient method of alerting the Coast
Guard and other boaters to an emergency situation. Operators of vessels
not equipped with a marine radio can use the \*16 service to contact the
nearest Marine Communications and Traffic Services (MCTS) Centre easily
in an emergency. Keying \*16 on your Bell Cellular, Cantel or Thunder
Bay Cellular telephone, connects you directly to the officer on duty at
the MCTS Centre, who will arrange assistance for you.

### Uses for \*16

The use of \*16 is normally restricted to obtaining assistance or
relaying information relating to Distress and Urgency situations.

### Distress

When using \*16 to report a distress situation, the following
information should be provided, when available:

- the location of the vessel,

- your cellular phone number,

- the nature of the emergency,

- the name or identification of the vessel,

- the number of persons on board,

- a description of the vessel,

- the type of assistance required,

- the weather conditions at your location.

The MCTS officer will seek assistance from vessels near your location
and forward the information to Search and Rescue authorities.

### Charges

The \*16 service is free to the cellular subscriber (no air-time or long
distance charges).

### Contacting the Coast Guard by Cellular Telephone for Other Needs

Other calls requesting information or other services provided by the
Marine Communications and Traffic Services Centre should be made to the
MCTS Centre's general telephone number as follows:

Thunder Bay - (807) 345-5190

Sarnia - (519) 336-4003

Prescott - (613) 925-4471

### Medical Advice

1.  Medical Advice Messages

    Masters of ships may obtain medical advice by addressing a
    radiotelegram to "Radiomedical" and routing it via the MCTS Centre
    which will refer the message to the nearest medial authority and
    transmit the reply to the ship.

2.  Radiomedical Marine Telephone Service

    Masters of ships may obtain medical advice by calling a MCTS Centre
    and request to be connected to a medical doctor. The MCTS Centre
    will connect the vessel to the appropriate medical authority via the
    Marine Telephone System. The cost of this service is absorbed by the
    MCTS Centre.
