The [CARD system](https://www.aboutkidshealth.ca/card/) provides
strategies that can be used to help cope before and during vaccination
and needle procedures. The system consists of resources such as videos,
handouts and activities that will help to prepare for a vaccination or
needle procedure.

Use the CARD system to have a more positive vaccination experience. The
CARD system (Comfort, Ask, Relax, Distract) provides groups of
strategies that can be used to make your vaccination experience a more
positive one. Learn how you can play your cards and use the different
strategies to reduce the pain, stress and worries associated with
vaccinations.

- Comfort - find ways to get comfortable
- Ask - ask questions to be prepared
- Relax - keep calm
- Distract - shift attention to something else
