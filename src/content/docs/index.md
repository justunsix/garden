This site is a digital garden which is like a knowledge base, wiki, and
second brain. The garden's articles are organized according to the
[Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC)
system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dewey_Decimal_classes) used
by libraries to organize information covering all knowledge. Index pages
for classes and articles are listed below. Most articles are on
technology, applied psychology, and health and sport.
