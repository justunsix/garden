The source code for my digital garden with notes and learning stuff.

## Usage

- Use regular
  [Astro setup and build commands](https://docs.astro.build/en/develop-and-build/)
- See `Makefile`

## Technology

- Website is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) website framework with
  [Starlight](https://github.com/withastro/starlight) theme.
- Markdown
  - Content is managed in [Emacs org](https://orgmode.org/) files and converted
    to markdown in this repository using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
  - Conversion to markdown is still being worked on so expect broken links,
    images, and problems in markdown files
- Hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/)
